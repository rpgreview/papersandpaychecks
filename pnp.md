# 0.0 Introduction

## 0.1 Foreword

It has been said, by wiser folks than I, that you can make a game out of just about anything.

The best advice my father gave me, however unwittingly, was that it was much easier to get along in "life" if you knew how to "play the game". And he was right; everything can be viewed through that prism. When I served in the US Navy, I learned Navy Regs front to back, thereby knowing just how to play that game whilst retaining some autonomy.

All of modern life is about rules: traffic laws, taxes, zoning, punching a time-clock (or the white collar equivalent); hidden and obvious, we are governed by rules. Rules are not just legislated; society's rules are not even written down, which would explain a great deal of the incivility running rampant on the World Wide Web.

This is a game about rules and bending them *where* you can, and ignoring them *if* you can when you don’t like them and seemingly functioning within those rules all the time. 

Inspiration for a game can come from the oddest places. This game was inspired by a cartoon drawn by Will McLean (now sadly deceased) that was used in the 1st Edition *AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide*. The authors style it as *"A roleplaying game of workers and students in an industrialized and technological society."*

Knowing full well what can happen to an RPG when the rules lawyers get their grubby little snouts buried in the guts of the rules, I will be listening for tales of how frustrated they became when they finally figured out that there are no work-arounds for life.

Some of the elements of this game will seem familiar, in a topsy-turvy fashion, to be sure, just a little bass-ackwards. Leveling up means a promotion; cross-training is allowed so career paths are wide open, from mailing room to penthouse. When viewed through that prism of gaming mentioned earlier, even the humdrum and mundane can made to be fun. That’s why I play games, to have fun. What is your motivation?

## 0.2 Preface

Welcome to "Papers and Paychecks: The Roleplaying Game of an Industrialized and Technological Society" in which you play the part of workers and students gloriously trying to succeed against a world of antagonists, and an antagonistic world. One player, "The Boss", will help you build a story by positing projects and placing obstacles that will challenge the player's characters from completing the objectives of their projects. 

The title comes from the memorable artwork of Will McLean in the first edition of the *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide*. A cursory search will reveal that on more than one occasion the thought has entered the heads of others that *Papers and Paychecks" would make a great roleplaying game, but this is the first time that the idea has seen completion. Of course, few workers these days deal as much with "papers", let alone "paychecks", but the game would hardly have the same ring to it if it was called "Emails and Direct Deposits". Such is the nature of being in a "industralized and technological society".

Roleplaying games have been an enormous success story in recent decades, starting with the original table-top versions and even some computer versions, in aggregate reaching out to tens of millions of people worldwide. The opportunity is provided in these games to engage in improvised storytelling within the structure of a rules system. The rules keep the storytelling within the bounds of plausibility and the character's capabilities within some level of consistency. 

Note the word 'plausibility'. *Papers and Paychecks* posits a world that is downright hostile to the player characters. The metaphysical foundation, if you like, is resistentialism. This is a supposedly joke philosophy based around the widespread anecdotal evidence of an apparent malice of inanimate objects against people, the word itself coined by Paul Jennings in 1948 as a response to existentialism, and claimed that it was developed by a fictional character, Pierre-Marie Ventre, itself a play on the name Jean-Paul Sartre.

But of course we all know better than that. Let our motto be: "Les choses sont contre nous" ("Things are against us"). Resistentialism and it has a long and established history well prior to Jennings, as encapsulated by "Murphy's Law" (itself possibly by the mathematician de Morgan, but he already has his own law) and completely expressed by Finagle's Law of Dynamic Negatives, by John W. Campbell, science fiction writer and editor who stated: "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible time".

Others characters in the story don't even have to be antagonistic - they may even be driven by pure motives, yet the the time in which they decide to incompetently help proves disastrous. It is the role of The Boss, the participant who narrates the story and moderates the game, to ensure that this happens. Ranging from slapstick, absurdity, and even a touch of malevolence, these situational comedies can used to reminisce, inform, and inspire.

Although presented partially as a spoof, "Papers and Paychecks" is nevertheless a traditional roleplaying game, in that it consists of several players, each taking a character (a "player-character" or PC) and their role in a story scenario designed by another player, The Boss, who adjudicates the expressed actions of the player's characters and the environment in which they occur, including the activities of non-player characters (NPCs), and introduces new plot elements as appropriate to generate a narrative flow. Usually it is played face-to-face, engaging in the primitive behaviour of actual physical socialisation, it can also be played through electronic communication as well, although real-time communication is recommended over asynchronous methods. 

There are five chapters to this book which explains tha game and how to play it. The first chapter is dedicated to character generation, covering the setting and an example of play, before illustrating the steps to build one's own player-character. This includes the PCs characteristics, profession and wage band, their talents, personality, and starting equipment. For those familiar with roleplaying games, this is a standard system but with the addition of the Luck attribute for narrative purposes.

By the end of the first chapter, the player is ready for action in an antagonistic environment, and the second chapter explains in detail exactly what sort of activities they can engage in. This includes an elaboration of the core mechanic game system, the tactical and strategic time scales, the giving and receiving of physical, mental, and social damage, and details of personal equipment. As a principle of game design, detail of the activities is based around the setting. Obviously this includes a lot less violence than a roleplaying game in a fantastic setting of wizards and dragons, but a lot more on problems relating to malfunctioning technology and incompetent bureaucracy.

A collection of non-player characters is offered as the third chapter, broken up according to profession and across various levels of ability. These can serve as example characters whom The Boss can introduce to a storyline, or, if the player is in a hurry, a quick template to introduce a new player-character to the game. For those familiar with such things this is the equivalent of a "Monster Manual".

The fourth chapter is The Boss book. It's full of advice on what it means to take up the role of moderator, adjudicator, narrator, director, and performer of the non-player characters. It also provides valuable information on setting, scenario, and episode design, along with ideas for the physical gaming environment.

The final chapter is an entire season of *Papers and Paychecks*, consisting of five episodes designed for beginner characters as they make their way into their first serious job. The episodes can be run independently, but are most enjoyable when the first links between them are brought together. 

The book concludes with a set of supplementary appendices; a collection of source material from which a Boss can delve into and develop their own project scenarios, some charts and tables for game play in summary, a business organisation chart, a *Dramatis Personae* chart for the Boss to keep track of NPCs during a session, and a résumé (a.k.a. character sheet) for major characters.

At the end of the day however, the main purpose of "Papers and Paychecks" is enjoyment. Consider this "Rule 0" of the game. If the game is not enjoyable then something has gone wrong and it needs to be addressed. It doesn't have to be *fun*, as such, to use the etymological sense i.e., foolish. Players as well as characters can have their own assumptions challenged, and things will not always go well for their characters (indeed, in *Papers & Paychecks* they can go very badly indeed). But rather it will give "enjoyment" and the act of exploring the shared imaginary space of a fictional universe that is like many of our own lives turned "up to eleven" will be provide entertainment, amusement, and perhaps even a little bit of insight. 

This game has a set of rules that is heavily inspired by the principles of 'playable realism'. The rules are sufficiently simple, even 'rules-light' in comparison to some monstrosities that have seen the light of day, but also provide a sense of realism, or at least verisimilitude. Quite obviously, given the origins of the cartoon in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (TM), one would not be surprised to see a significant influence by various editions of that game in this design. Nevertheless, as with many other games, If a situation arises that is not covered in the rules, The Boss should make a fast decision to continue play and if necessary the players can all revisit the situation outside of play. Consider this "Rule 1" - The Boss Rule. All rules in this book are subject to the whim of The Boss.

By way of conclusion, a couple of other matters of note must be raised. This game does deal with situations that are obviously more contemporary, but with also 'adult concepts' (after all, it involves playing the role of adult characters) and is recommended for mature readers.  Circumstances should not arise involving the massacre an orc extended family with fire and sword, but it might involve a flirtatious and somewhat inebriated co-worker at an office party. Make of that what you will. It also means that occassionally Anglo-Saxon words for profanities will be used; Norman-French words, of course, are noble, educated, and never there profane, peasant. To rewrite George Carlin; "feces, urine, copulate, vagina, fellator, mater-copulator, and teats". 

This game has been published by the RPG Review Cooperative, an incorporated and non-profit association. Nobody associated with the Cooperative is making any money from this - all proceeds go to the association for the benefit of promoting our shared hobby - and as such we are particularly grateful for the generosity of our backers on Kickstarter. We are also deeply honoured to have the artistic skills of Dan 'Smif' Smith for the cover art. Special thanks is also given to the playtesters, who reviewed and tested the game, pulled it apart and put it back together again into the working product you see before you. 

Enjoy the game and remember: "Les choses sont contre nous"!

## 0.3 Dice

The polyhedral dice of tabletop roleplaying games are a well-established feature, originally a mathematical tool in schools, and are readily available from hobby stores or online. Dice are used to simulate the effects of various effects which are simply too fiddly to add up in the imperfect model that RPGs represent, and to create a sense of tension and uncertainty. If for some reason such dice are not available a deck of playing cards can be an equal substitute with the appropriate number range taken out as needed i.e., 1-4, 1-6, 1-8, 1-10, 1-12 and a 1-10 with black or red suit cards to determine whether the range is 1-10 (clubs or spades) or 11-20 (hearts or diamonds).

"Papers and Paychecks" uses the standard set; the four-sided dice, the six-sided, the eight-sided, the ten-sided, the twelve-sided, and the twenty-sided. Depending on the rule being applied the value on the die's face is the score that is applied. An exception is the ten-sided dice which can either be used as a single ten-sided value, or, if two are used (different colours is recommended), where one of the two represents the decimal place of tens, whereas the other represents a value of ones, creating a percentage value. A result of '00' would equate to 100, giving a range of 1 to 100. Alternatively, you may be able to find a one-hundred-sided dice. These are frequently poorly designed with a each dice having a hidden tendency to roll low or high. As such they are perfect for "Papers and Paychecks"; after all "Les choses sont contre nous"!

Standard dice notation is used throughout Papers and Paychecks; a quantity of dice is specificed first followed by the 'd' notation to represent 'dice', and then the dice-value. If necessary addition and subraction may be added. Thus, by example, 2d6+4 would mean the sum of two six-sixed dice plus 4, a range of 6 to 16, 3d6 would mean the sum of three six-sided die rolls giving a range of 3 to 18, d100 would represent the percentage value explained above. 

## 0.4 Core Mechanic

The core mechanic of Papers & Paychecks, as per the original cartoon, is a 2d6 die roll to be used in dramatic circumstances, either tactical or strategic. This is applied with characteristic and skill bonus plus environment modifiers against a target number which will vary according to the difficulty of the task. As Quick Resolution of the target numbers the following table can be used, with Target Numbers equating to the difficulty for "an average person" without modifications from specialist training, and as if negative modifiers for lacking such training existed. These target numbers can be used as a "quick and dirty" alternative to the more explicit detailed modifiers used described in chapter 2. However a couple of warnings; use one or the other, but not both at the same time, and for The Boss, be consistent.

> For example, A Boss decides to reserve the detailed calculations in the rules for strategic actions and the quick resolution method for fast, tactical circumstances. In a series of unfortunate events our workers find themselves transporting several cages of rats by trolley through a sewer system underneath a campus - however they reach a point where it the only way across is a 3 m standing jump with a caged rat in a wet and dark environment, a difficulty that The Boss quickly decides is "Tough". The next character that attempts the same jump should also have the same difficulty - and as it should be in the future. Don't forget it!

| Difficulty		| Rating	|
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Very easy		| 5		|
| Easy			| 7		|
| Average		| 9		|
| Tough			| 11		|
| Challenging		| 13		|
| Formidable	 	| 15		|
| Heroic		| 17		|
| Nearly Impossible	| 19		|

The Target Numbers also however represent a grade of success or failure. If a character makes the test equal to or above the target number, they have achieved a success. If they have a result below the target number the character has failed in their task. The degree of success (or failure) also makes a difference. 

If the success is just equal to the value the player has two choices. First, the player chooses a success for the character, the Boss will apply a proportional failure either immediately or at a later date. Alternatively, the player may decide to forgo the success and have a failure without consequences. If they succeed at a grade above the target number (e.g., a result of 11 or more for an average task) the character has succeeded without consequences. If they succeed two grades above (e.g., a result of 13 or more for an average task), the character succeeds with a benefit. Likewise if they succeed three grades above, they receive two benefits. The player may choose an benefits equal to a successful skill roll or similar check, either immediately or in the future.

> "Wait, every marginal success is also a failure?"
> "Yes, welcome to *Papers & Paychecks*, a world where... things are against us!

The same applies for failed skill rolls. If a character's skill check is within the immediate grade range below the Target Number of difficulty (e.g., a result of 7 or 8 on an Average task), the result is a marginal failure with no further consequences. If the result is a grade below (e.g., a result of 6 or 7 on an Average Taks), a further consequence is applied in addition to the failure.

Note the initial sentence that the die roll is to be used "used in dramatic circumstances". If a character is sufficiently unhurried or has sufficient resources they can opt to ignore the die roll at take a flat 7 plus modifiers result instead; these are 'prosaic circumstances'. By 'prosaic' this means that the character has at least twice the time to take than what would be required for a dramatic action, or in the case of financial transactions, they are able to pay twice the cost. In a sense, characters are caught in the famous project management trilemma; good, cheap, or fast - pick two.

Regardless of whether a situation is 'dramatic' or 'prosaic', modifiers to a given check or roll 'stack' (i.e., combine for a cumulative effect) if they come from different sources, but do not stack if they have the same source (e.g., two uses of a skill roll).

## 0.5 Glossary

**Action**: An activity that a character performs. An action may be applied in tactical or strategic time scales. Tactical actions include standard actions, which take a moderate amount of effort and time, short actions, which are quick but not not unlimited in time, and free actions, which are effectively zero time actions.

**Boss, The**: A special type of player who manages the world, the actions of Non-Player Characters, who sets the scene, scenario, and challenges for Player-Characters. The Boss acts as both a narrator and referree.

**Bruises**: Short-term and typically non-critical damage, whether inflicted from physical, mental, or social conflict. See also *wounds*. When a character has reached 0 bruises, they are unconscious, shocked, or ostracised. The character may not act until they have recovered or healed. 

**Character**: A *natural* person (as opposed to a *legal* person, which includes companies and associations) in the *Papers & Paychecks* world. Characters are of two broad types, "Player-Characters" (PCs), those whose actions are primarily determined by a player, and "Non-Player Characters" (NPCs), whose actions are determined by The Boss. See also *Worker*.

**Characteristic**: An foundational value for a character which is less subject to trained improvement. The range for starting characters is the sum of 3d6. The characteristics are Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (PER), and Charisma (CHA).

**Detailed Resolution**: Where the Target Number of a skill or knowledge is calculated by a detailed examination of specific circumstances. 

**Dramatic Action**: Any check that requires a roll of the dice to simulate a degree of uncertainty and narrative tension. The core mechanic of Dramatic Action in "Papers & Paychecks" is a 2d6 die roll against a target number, which can result in success with benefits, success, success with consequences, failure, failure with consequences.

**Luck**: A metagame value that players may use to alter the result of a die-roll that they are unhappy with. Luck is awarded by the GM for particularly impressive contributions to the game experience, and may also be subtracted for negative contributions. Luck is a player characteristic, not a character characteristic, and may be transferred by a player between different characters within the same gaming group.

**Player**: A real-life participant in the game. Players either manage the behaviour of Player-Characters in the game (c.f.,) or, in a particular case, take up the special role of The Boss. All players have a 'social contract' with other players to help keep the game enjoyable and interesting for everyone. Also known as "Rule 0.5", it is famously expressed by roleplayer Will Wheaton during his keynote speech at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) in August 2007: "Don't be a dick".

**Prosaic Action**: Any check that does not require a roll of the dice, and does not represent a situation where the character is vexed by uncertainty or narrative tension. The character opts for an average result instead of a normal die roll, but undergoes the same scope of results as a 'Dramatic Action'.

**Quick Resolution**: Where a Target Number for a skill or knowledge is assigned 'on the fly' based on a description of the circumstances. This should be consistent if the characters encounter the same task.

**Tactical Action**: Immediate actions by a character which can be carried out within a ten-second time-frame. Also known as a *round*.

**Skill Points**: The number of points a character can spend per level on skills and knowledges. It is based on the character's INT bonus.

**Strategic Action**: Involved actions by a character which can be carried out within a four-hour time-frame. Also known as a *turn*.

**Worker** A character in Papers & Paychecks who works, *almost* synonymous with NPC or PC. Distinguished from "worker", which can refer to any almost character. *Owners* tend to stay out of play and behind the scenes, making them even more insidious.

# 1.0 Character Generation

## 1.1 Example of Play

The following is the opening scene of five players of "Papers and Paperchecks". 'The Boss', has set the game within a small university research team. The other players have the characters of Walter, the team leader, a low-level manager, Ingrid, a computer scientist, Seth, a post-graduate health scientist, Mary, an administrator, and Gerald, a technician.
 
> *The Boss*: It's Monday morning at the office - small, cold, and underfunded, because those things provide great inspiration to scientific research.  However, the sweet nectar of coffee is available. Except the machine isn't working again.
> 
> *Everyone*: *groans*.
> 
> *Gerald*: "OK everyone, stand back. The technician is here". What's wrong with it?
> 
> *The Boss*: The machine displays 'Dredgedrawer is full'.
> 
> *Gerald*: Easy enough. I take the dredgedrawer out, empty it, give it a clean and put it back in.
> 
> *The Boss*: Now it says 'Dredgedrawer missing'.
> 
> *Gerald*: Oh come now. I wriggle it around a bit. I open and close the service door.
> 
> *The Boss*: OK, make an 'Electrical Technician' roll at +2.
> 
> (Gerald's player rolls a 2d6 - as per the original cartoon for "Papers and Paychecks"- and checks their resume or character sheet for their skill rating. They add their adding their skill and attribute bonus plus the +2 bonus, scoring an 10 in total, above the normal target number of 8. The result is a "success with consequences".
> 
> *The Boss*: Congratulations, the machine roars into action. Except now it says 'Refill Beans'. (Note that the consequence is proportional to the success)
> 
> *Mary*: That's part of my job! 
> 
> *The Boss*: Well, we'd better check that you ordered some. An Administration check for office supplies please.
> 
> *Mary*: It never ends. 
> 
> (Mary's player rolls a 2d6 plus their bonuses, scoring a total of 8 - a bare success, with consequences.)
> 
> Mary: Just as well that was one of my main skills. Now please let us have a coffee!
> 
> (The Boss considers having the milk in fridge go off, but decides against it, for now - and notes it down as a future consequence. It will make for a good event in another scene)
> 
> *The Boss*: Well now you all have coffee according to your preferred tastes. You are in the meeting room preparing the activities for the week. Walter's phone rings. It's the head of department, Professor Fleur Power.
> 
> *Walter*: I suppose I'd better answer it. "Hello professor! How can we help you this fine day?"
> 
> *The Boss*: Professor Power complains about the weather. However she does mention that the Dean has received a message that the Minister of Health is making a surprise visit and that there needs to be a breakthrough this week on cardiovascular disease to receive more funding.
> 
> *Walter*: "Umm.. The Minister does know that that we just can't generate scientific discoveries like that?"
> 
> *The Boss*: (Playing Professor Power) "No, the Minister does not know that and nor does the university marketing department. Marketing thinks we need to make the claim so we get additional funding. So get some models up and running that match some empirical tests and show that a certain activity leads to reduced blood pressure. You have until four pm". Professor Power hangs up. 
> 
> *Walter*: Well, I'll relay the news to the rest of the team and try to inspire them. I'll roll against my "Inspire" skill; a 12, bringing the total to 18! (The player stands from the table and gesticulates wildly addressing the others) "Come on now team, we know the drill. At the end of the day we need to action this, so let's think outside the box, and have an idea shower. We'll look under the bonnet and get all our ducks in a row."
> (Groans from other players who have actually heard these phrases at their workplace, even as mixed metaphors) 
> 
> *The Boss*: Very good! You get a Luck point for that truly cringeworthy performance.
> 
> (A Luck point allows the player to modify a rolled result to whatever value they desire)
> 
> *Seth*: Well, what do we have? Isn't there some lab rats or something on campus that are used for such studies?
> 
> *The Boss*: Sure is; very well known too. Make a Science (biology) roll with a +2 bonus.
> 
> *Seth*: Well that brings my score from +5 to +7, I should succeed at this. (Rolls a 11 in total). OK, I made it clean, thanks to the bonus.
> 
> *The Boss*: Well there is the SHR, or spontaneously hypertensive rat. You also know that the medical school does have some of these and there's a special dataset that's been studying the effects of diet. There's three populations of rat, one that's been fed a diet high in fat, sodium, and alcohol, one that's been fed a diet rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium, and a control group that's been fed a normal diet, whatever that is for a lab rat. 
> 
> *Mary*: "I'm not sure which rat I'll have the most sympathy for. The one that's spent its life on chips, soda, and booze and is sick or the one that's healthy and have been eating wholegrains and raw vegetables"
> 
> *Seth*: "It doesn't matter, this is great news! We can bring up the dataset, run the simulation, and correlate the results with our loyal rodent allies who we can use to provide empirical evidence to the Minister!"
> 
> (The Boss smiles inwardly thinking of the enormous variety of things that could go wrong with lab rats with hypertension meeting a Minister of Health. Perhaps a biting incident is in order.)
> 
> *Ingrid*: Sounds like my cue. I bring up the database on the cluster. How long will the simulation take?
> 
> *The Boss*: About three hours. However the system is unusually sluggish. Looks like the storage array is full.
> 
> *Ingrid*: It never just rains, does it? OK, I do make a 'Computer (Operating Systems)' check. Total roll of 7. Ugh, what a terrible result. I spend a Luck Point and turn the failure into a success.

## 1.2 Luck Rating

All player characters start with a Luck rating of 3 points. As a meta-game characteristic this is established prior to anything else. It represents the ability of the players to change the result of a random roll that is under their control within the story. For example. a player, during character generation, has their heart set on taking up the Scientist character class. Alas, the genetic die is not with them and they roll a paltry 7 from 3d6 to determine their Intelligence characteristic. A moment is spent as the player considers the possibility of playing a fairly dim scientist, but they decide against it spending one of their three Luck points to change the score of 7 to 18, the maximum that could be rolled.

> Other games have similar metagame currency; the *James Bond007* game had Hero/Survival points, *Rolemaster* (in a certain Companion) had Fate Points, FATE, as the name indicates, has Fate Points, *Savage Worlds* has Bennies and so forth. A crucial difference between the Luck points used in *Papers & Paychecks* is that because it is a meta-game award to the player, the number of Luck points belongs to the player, which they can use as they wish - even for or against other characters.

During the course of a story, a player who engages in particularly spectacular in-character behaviour may be awarded additional Luck points. Within the game itself, this opportunity occurs on a roll of '2' or '12', representing the extremes of skill tests, and can be expressed as particularly inspirational speeches and expositions of circumstances. Yes, a player who rolls a disastrous value for their character (a '2'), and invokes all sorts of problems for their character - even if they succeed in the skill roll due to various bonuses - can receive a bonus Luck point for making life difficult for their own character. 

On a metagame level it can awarded by dressing outrageously in character, providing a stack of possible NPCs Workers for The Boss, or providing an utter feast for those attending the session. In a nutshell, that which makes the session truly astounding and special. Likewise failure to contribute (e.g., missing a session, going completely against the character) can cause the loss of a Luck point. A player whose character who has negative Luck points will find that The Boss will fudge random events against them - which can be very bad in the Resisentialist environment.

Keep in mind that these are a metagame award to the players, not just to the characters, effectively a rating of how well they have 'acted' in character and their contribution to the game group. Hence the resume tracks the total points awarded and the points that the player has left. If a player takes up another character within their same group they can transfer their Luck points to the new character. 

Note that for certain NPCs or items of equipment, the Boss may allocate Luck points to such characters reflecting their importance in the wider story. Unlike points for PC Workers, these will not improve.

## 1.3 Background

The Background of a character in *Papers & Paychecks* initially consists of their starting wealth. In a general sense the price of a good equals the price of the good in the location of the game's setting, around 2016-2017 which is presumed to be in a advanced economy (e.g., North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Republic of Korea). In "Papers and Paychecks" characters have a starting wealth along with the income that they receive according to their level and profession. Starting wealth is random, based on a 2d6 roll, times $1000. This random roll also determines the net value of the character's inheritance. The value of this inheritance will be ten times the character's starting wealth.

The time that this inheritance is received will be on the (2d6*2) + 20th year of the character. This value will typically be kept in secret by the The Boss as part of the character's development. Note that a player may spend a Luck Point to determine exactly what age they will receive their inheritance and, in some cases, this may even occur before the start of play.

> Andrew is designing a character for *Papers & Paychecks* and rolls a '12' on 2d6 for $120,000 worth of starting wealth. Having read ahead the player likes the idea of playing a Scientist, dedicated to fighting evil in the office place. "I'll be like the office Batman!", the player exclaims. "Except I'll need even more money. I'll spend a Luck point to *kill my parents early*, and turn that result to '2' on 2d6 for age of inheritance received, which make a total of 24 years when I receive a cool $1.2 million."   
"You are *cold*", responds the Boss.    
"But only for the greater good!", the player retorts.

Other background features should be derived from the initial wealth roll. Characters with a high initial wealth, for example, will typically come from good neighbourhoods with a stable family life. At the other end of the scale are the poor in their tenement housing in their rough neighbourhoods with above average incidence of petty drug problems, violence, and property crimes. As the distribution would indicate, most people fit around the middle.

Whilst it is rarely necessary when a player initially generates their character, over time a player may develop a complex background and current history for their character, including relations with immediate family, close friends, intimate associations, rivals and enemies and so forth. Such a background can provide a rich resource for The Boss to develop scenarios and a well-developed and probable background will receive rewards in the form of having such associated characters being part of the project scenarios and with the reward of Luck Points.

## 1.4 Characteristics

Characteristics are the basic attributes of a *Papers and Paychecks* character. They are used to determine innate abilities which are not augmented by skills, and they determine the default values for various skills. As with numerous other games, Characteristics are determined by the sum of a 3d6 rolls, six times in order, for Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Perception (PER), and Charisma (CHA). 

Players are reminded of their Luck Rating (1.2) and may wish to take the opportunity to use at least one point when generating these values. "Papers and Paychecks" is "realistic" insofar that characteristics are random, but "narrativist", in the sense that players can intervene if they so choose to ensure that they have the sort of character they want. 

Characters in *Papers and Paychecks* have level one starting age based on their profession. However as the age category for all level one characters is based on the "young adult" age category the practical effect is that they will begin with the same range of characteristic values. Again, as a "realistic" game there is significant modifications according to age. The effects of each ageing step are non-cumulative.

|Starting Age		| Character Profession	|
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 15+1d4 (average 17-18)| Labourers		|
| 15+3d4 (average 22-23)| Scientists		|
| 15+1d6 (average 18-19)| Administrators	|
| 15+1d6 (average 18-19)| Tradesperson		|
| 15+2d4 (average 20)   | Researchers		|
| 15+3d4 (average 22-23)| Managers		|


| Age Category		| Characteristic Modifier	|
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Infant (0 to 3)	| -75% to all characteristics	|
| Child (4 to 15)	| -50% to all characteristics	|
| Young Adult (16 to 39)| No change			|
| Middle Age (40 to 59) | -20% to Dex, -10% to Str, Con, +10% to Wis, Cha |
| Old Age (60 to 79)	| -30% to Dex, -20% to Str, Con, +20% to Wis, Cha |
| Venerable (80+)	| -50% to Dex, -30% to Str, Con, +30% to Wis, Cha |

Sexual dimorphism in the human species across cultures is a well-documented reality; in game terms this would mean that female characters would, on average, have a Strength attribute about 10% less (incorporating both size and health), but a bonus Dexterity of around 10% more. Likewise 'racial' (clinal) differences indicating, from a zoological point of view, a minimal gradual change in average physical characteristics throughout the species along with epigenetic influences on all characteristics as well. The Boss should keep these distributions in mind when generating NPC. Player-characters may, of course, choose whatever sex or ethnic background that they desire regardless of die-roll results.

The result of the 3d6 roll gives a range of 3-18. A universal table for bonuses or penalties for characteristic values is applied for skill tests similar tests when the characteristic in question is invoked. In addition the bonus multiplied by 10% is used for pay for relevant professions and for Wisdom to represent their prudent expenditures and investments. 

For example, a character with a Strength of 18 will receive a +4 bonus for all Strength-related skill tests. If the same character is a Labourer they will receive a bonus of +40% to their average weekly wage. If they also had a Wisdom of 12, the character would receive a bonus of +50%!
 
| Value | Skill Bonus | Wage Bonus | 
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1	|       -5    |    -50%    |
| 2-3	|       -4    |    -40%    |
| 4-5	|       -3    |    -30%    |
| 6-7	|       -2    |    -20%    | 
| 8-9	|       -1    |    -10%    |
| 10-11	|        0    |      0%    |
| 12-13	|       +1    |    -10%    |
| 14-15	|       +2    |    -20%    |
| 16-17	|       +3    |    -30%    | 
| 18-19	|       +4    |    +40%    |
| etc	|       etc   |    etc     |

In addition to the aforementioned primary characteristics, there is also a number of secondary, derived, or enumerated characteristics (pick whichever term suits your group and their level of geekdom, but "secondary" will be used as the lowest common denominator). 

**Strength**: Strength represents their mass, musculature, and health. By itself Strength doesn't contribute much in terms of skills (the characteristic bonus is applied in melee combat), but it does include a number of secondary characteristics. Also, various physical feats are dependent on Strength, including lifting things, moving things, shoving them over, the distance they can jump, and so forth. See sections 2.3 (Tactical Task Resolution) and 2.4 (Strategic Task Resolution) for further details. A human character's Move is based on half their Strength, representing the number of metres per second. A character's Strength determines their Physical Hit Points.

**Intelligence**: Intelligence is a combination of a character's memory, reasoning, and general education. Almost the reverse of Strength, it is not used for many unskilled actions with the exception of occasional pure logic problems or general knowledge questions, but it is used a great deal as the default value for many skills. Intelligence is a major factor in the number of skill points a character acquires per level; 4 + the character's INT bonus (a character can have as low as 0 skill points per level, i.e. "too stupid to learn"). Intelligence also sets a hard limit to the number of skill points that a character can invest.

> --Robert Allen, 2017, `https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-high-IQ-people-amount-to-nothing/answer/Robert-Allen-52`

**Wisdom**: Wisdom represents the character's stability of mind, willpower, intellectual clarity, judgement, moral reasoning, and common sense. Wisdom however does not contribute significantly to secondary characteristics or skills, with most resolution tests being based directly on tests against the characteristic itself. An important exception is that a character's Wisdom bonus times 10% directly contributes as a wage bonus, representing both prudent investments and expenditure, plus performance bonuses. This applies to all professions, and effectively doubles the bonus for Administrators. A character's Wisdom determines their Mental Hit Points.

**Dexterity**: Dexterity represents fine manipulation, reflexes, flexibility, balance, and hand-eye coordination. It is used in a significant number of physical skills, and is also fairly common in direct characteristic tests. A character receives one standard action at 5 points or less of Dexterity, two from 6 to 15, three from 16 to 25 etc. Note that a character with a high Dexterity effectively increases their movement rate per round, albeit in a coarsely-grained fashion.

**Perception**: Perception represents the character's awareness and ability to receive and interpret information from their sensory systems and is typically associated with a character's general level of health relative to their size (i.e., their constitution in the vernacular). Perception only affects a handful of skills, but is possibly the most common characteristic test.

**Charisma**: Charisma is a combination personality, popularity, appearance, and social status. Charisma modifiers are used in a large variety of social skills, as well as tests for the loyalty of friends and associates. It does not, however, contribute significantly to secondary skills. Charisma is used for Social Hit Points.

## 1.5 Professions

"Papers and Paychecks" has six character professions, each of which has a related primary characteristic. The player chooses which character profession they belong to and in most cases will select the profession with that primary characteristic. Not only are many of the character's activities most successful with that related value, but they will also receive a pay bonus.

The professions, and their related primary characteristics, are: Labourer (Strength)., Scientist (Intelligence)., Administrator (Wisdom)., Tradesperson (Dexterity)., Researcher (Perception)., Manager (Charisma). The pay bonus or penalty they receive is equal to ten times the characteristic bonus as a percentage. That is, a Labourer with the extraordinary Strength of 18, would receive a 40% bonus in their paycheck.

As with other classic games, "Papers and Paychecks" is a "gold piece system", but in reverse. Whereas in traditional RPGs one received "experience points" for acquiring treasure, in "Papers and Paychecks" your character will receive "treasure" (i.e., a paycheck) for having experience. 

This is also a "class and level" game. The "classes" are, of course, represented by the various professions. Unlike however traditional games, the "class" is not a straight-jacket which restricts the character, in "Papers and Paychecks" the profession is a flexible set of options. Characters may also change their profession as they wish, and often a character will have multiple professions representing a change in employment (e.g., a level 4 Labourer and level 6 Tradesperson). The character will receive the pay rate according to the work that they are currently doing. If this sounds unfair, ask a migrant cleaner with a PhD in nuclear physics how they feel about it.

Each character has a level, representing their pay band and the base net wages that they receive. This level is determined by how many "projects" that they have completed, a "project" being the equivalent of a "scenario" or “adventure” in a fantasy RPG. On average, a character can expect to participate in one project per annum. Different professions have different starting ages, and different rates of pay. 

The abstract level rate of advancement is however the same, depending on the number of projects completed. *Papers & Paychecks assumes that low-level characters will undergo one or perhaps two major projects in an exceptional year, with the rest of their time engaging in operational work. As a result the sum total of a character's level can be used to estimate the character's age as well, at least at low levels. At higher levels however it is not unusual for characters to become more project-focussed. Very experienced and successful characters may find that they are constantly in project roles, as major troubleshooters.

| Level | Projects | Reputation	| Average Age |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| 1	| 0        | -5		|     20      |
| 2	| 1        | -4		|     21      |
| 3	| 2        | -3		|     22      |
| 4	| 3        | -2		|     23      |
| 5	| 5        | -1		|     25      |
| 6	| 8        | +0		|     28      |
| 7	| 13       | +1		|     33      |
| 8	| 21       | +2		|     41      |
| 9	| 34       | +3		|     50      |
| 10	| 65       | +4		|     58      |

The Reputation value of a character represents how well known they are to others. Simply roll 2d6 and add the bonus as determined from their level and attempt to achieve a difficulty value according to the level of detail and the social distance. Remembering a co-worker's name (+3) who works on the same floor (+3), for example, is a 'very easy' task (+6). Remembering a two-year old project (-3) in which a worker in a different company (-4) was involved in would be 'nearly impossible' (-7), assuming that in both cases the character is 6th level.

Each level brings improvements to a character based on their profession. This includes improvements to skills and knowledges and acquisition of new perks. To represent personality development, players can change their MBTI personality value (see section 1.8, Personality) by one point in each of the four dimensions. 

Note that there is no level after 10. After several projects at this level, having completed over 65 projects in a chosen profession there will be various hints expressed throughout the workplace that "perhaps you should spend more time with your family", "wouldn't it be great to receive a gold watch", "it's wonderful that younger people are following in your footsteps", and such-like. At a certain point the character will have to realise that their life has been spent as a cog in someone else's machine. Take out a red pen and write "RETIRED" across your character sheet, and hope there's enough money in the character's pension fund.

### 1.5.1 Labourer

Prime Requisite: Strength
Starting Age: 15+1d4
Profession Skills: Athletics (Strength), Athletics (stamina), Intimidate, Melee, Knowledge (General), Profession, Craft (structural), Carousing, Sense (various) 

Description: A labourer works with their hands for the livelihood. Typically found in the construction industry, it is not a character profession that has a wide range of skills, nor does that is often found within an office-environment. Whilst not known for the intellect, they are known for their ability to lift heavy things which often comes with significant sex appeal. As a result, some office workers react to labourers with a peculiar combination of envy and disgust. Labourers are the only profession that gains points in physical characteristics as their level improves. They have a very good weekly-wage for a profession, at least in the initial levels. The starting age of a labourer with no prior profession is often quite young.

| Level | Wage     | Perks			|
|-------|----------|----------------------------|
| 1	| $700     | Union Membership           |
| 2	| $800     | +1 to STR, DEX, or PER	|
| 3	| $900     | Apprentice                 |
| 4	| $1000    | +1 to STR, DEX, or PER     |
| 5	| $1100    | Security Access            |

| 8	| $1250    | +1 to STR, DEX, or PER     |
| 9	| $1300    | Project Manager		|
| 10	| $1350    | Superannuation	        |

### 1.5.2 Scientist

Prime Requisite: Intelligence
Starting Age: 15+3d4
Profession Skills: Craft (Computing), Craft (chemical), Craft (pharmaceutical), Craft (writing), Investigate, Knowledge (Sciences), Knowledge (Philosophy), Knowledge (General), Language (various)
 
Description: A scientist works with their mind for the livelihood. Typically found in academia, research industries, and in hospitals, scientists are rather notorious for having detailed knowledge on specific subjects, and not much in the way of practical skills. As a result their office-environments are often an "sheltered workshop for the intellectually able". Despite their intelligence, they are often subject to unkind comments about their social skills, pay rates, and sometimes even personal hygiene. In turn, scientists will smile and ponder the myriad of ways to remove the nuclear force that holds their interlocutors atoms together. Scientists have average pay, some unusual perks, and have a late starting age. 

| Level | Wage     | Perks		   |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|
| 1	| $500     | Laboratory Equipment  |
| 2	| $600     | Conference Attendance |
| 3	| $700     | Read/Write Science    |

| 5	| $900     | +1 to INT	           |
| 6	| $1050    | Team Leader           |
| 7	| $1250    | Spurious Logic        |
| 8	| $1500    | Project Manager       |
| 9	| $1750    | +1 to INT	           |
| 10	| $2050    | Superannuation        |

### 1.5.3 Administrator

Prime Requisite: Wisdom
Starting Age: 15+1d6
Profession Skills: Craft (Computing), Knowledge (General), Administration, Profession, Sleight, Concentration, Sense (various), Act, Lie

Description: An administrator works with their judgement for their livelihood. Stunningly practical in the intellectual sense, it is administrators who are often the real backbone of an organisation ensuring that the paperwork is filled properly, the bills are paid on time, and the stationery cabinet stock is up-to-date. Despite this they are usually looked down upon by the supposed geniuses and decision-makers in an organisation who would otherwise forget these mundane tasks. Those who are wise know however that the administrators are the true power behind any company - which is why wise people often become administrators. They have some rather practical and surprising perks, which makes up for unspectacular pay. Administrators start young in life.

### 1.5.4 Tradesperson

Prime Requisite: Dexterity
Starting Age: 15+1d6
Profession Skills: Craft (electronic), Craft (mechanical), Craft (structural), Profession, Knowledge (Science), Knowledge (General), Carousing, Concentration, Sense (various)

Description: A tradesperson works with their clever hands for their livelihood with a variety of practical physical skills. If it is a electro-mechanical device and it's broken, the tradesperson can fix it. This represents not only those professions in the manufacturing industry, or construction, but also the hands-on specialist technical workers (as a result, "tradesperson" and "technician" can sometimes be used interchangeably, depending on the type of work). Tradespeople start off with poor renumeration, but one which improves over time. They start their career at a young age.

### 1.5.5 Researcher

Prime Requisite: Perception
Starting Age: 15+2d4
Profession Skills: Investigate, Knowledge (Arts), Knowledge (Laws), Knowledge (Sciences), Knowledge (Philosophy), Profession, Concentration, Insight, Sense (various)

Description: A researcher works with their insight and investigative skills for their livelihood. It is their stubborn ability to pore over details looking for the hidden causes of things which makes a researcher especially valuable in an organisation. Nevertheless, they are easily overlooked as they often work long hours and away from the social lives of others, and receive a rather poor renumeration as a result. Researchers start their career at an average age.

Prime Requisite: Charisma
Starting Age: 15+3d4
Profession Skills: Knowledge (General), Administration, Profession, Carousing, Act, Bully, Inspire, Lie, Seduce

Description: A manager works with force of personality for their livelihood. Which means they get everyone else to do the real work, whereas they make the decisions of what work needs to be done. This often means meeting with other managers and arguing over corporate goals, resource allocation, and who is going to buy the third bottle of Maison Veuve Clicquot. It is notable that managers have very few practical skills, but they do have some amazing social perks. Whilst they may start in exciting jobs in sales, those who toe the line can often find themselves on a very fruitful career.  Managers start their career at a later age.

## 1.6 Skills and Knowledges

Skills and other actions in "Papers and Paychecks" are determined by the following procedure, as per the original cartoon:  2d6 + characteristic bonus or penalty + environment bonuses or penalty versus a target number with variation from that target number determining degrees of success. There are no "natural" successes or failures from rolling a '2' or '12', for example, as a result; a character *could* succeed with a natural roll of '2' if their bonuses are high enough or fail with a '12' if their penalties are sufficiently severe. Further elaboration of the resolution of action will be found in chapter two, especially sections 2.3 and 2.4

Skills are defined by their associated characteristic, the default value, and the encumbrance penalty if applicable. The associated characteristic is a modifier to the skill attempted. The default value is a penalty that is applied if the character has no training or experience in that skill, that is, they are operating from their natural acumen alone. Each skill point spent in a skill provides a +1 bonus to that skill.

Many skills have required or optional specialisations. Required specialisations are essentially separate skills. Optional specialisations are a narrow implementation of a base skill, and provide a +2 bonus for each skill point spent. At this stage, the skills are given the brief descriptions to satisfy the requirements of character generation. A more complete description of their implementation is found in section 2.2 and section 2.3

Characters also receive a number of skills and knowledges during their childhood and adolescence based on their starting wealth and therefore their social class and education. The following table provides these values and the number of skill points.

| Rolled Wealth	| Skill and Knowledges									|
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2		| Language (own) 1, Athletics 2, Intimidate 1, Melee 1, Craft 2, Knowledge 1, Hobby 1, Perception 1, Pilot 1, Carousing 1 | 
| 3-5		| Language (own) 2, Athletics 1, Craft 3, Knowledge 1, Hobby 2, Perception 1, Pilot 1, Carousing 1 |
| 6-8		| Language (own) 3, Athletics 1, Craft 3, Knowledge 2, Perception 1, Pilot 1, Carousing 1 |
| 9-11		| Language (own) 4, Language (foreign) 1, Knowledge 3, Perception 1, Profession 1, Pilot 1, Carousing 1, | 
| 12		| Language (own) 5, Language (foreign) 2, Knowledge 2, Pilot 1, Act 1, Carousing 1 |

Character are limited in the number of skills points they can spend per level. They are limited by their INT characteristic for the total number of skill points available per level and they are limited by the Profession on the number of skill points that can be spent on a particular skill or knowledge (or specialisation). For professional skills, a +1 bonus costs 1 experience points, a +2 bonus costs 3 experience points, and a +3 bonus costs 6 experience points. For non-professional skills, the cost is double.

> Allie Viate, the office clown and skilled administrator, has just advanced to 4th level. With their INT of 13, they receive 5 skills points. They spend 1 point for +1 on the three professional skills on Craft (Computing), Administration, Concentration. Based on a recent experience with a aggressive fishmonger armed with haddock, they decide they need +1 on melee, a non-professional skill, for 2 skills points.

### Strength Based Skills

There are few Strength based skills, but they have a wide application. Strength-based skills have a default of -2 for the unksilled, recognising that these skills are heavily influenced by the physical ability of the character.

**Athletics (Strength)**

An Athletics (strength) skill check is made when a character wishes to engage in various track-and-field events which strongly depend on their physical musculature. This includes distance-based throwing (e.g., hammer throw, shot put, weight throw), sprints, and hurdles. {if incorporate melee into this add combat sports like boxing, wrestling, brawling etc}

**Athletics (stamina)**

An Athletics (stamina) skill check is made when a character is engaging in events which involve fitness and stamina. This includes hiking, cross-country running (e.g., alpine running), race walking, triathlons, free-diving, long distance running, etc. Many workplace social cliques revolve around cycling, jogging, and other endurance activities.

**Climb**

A Climb check is used whenever a character is required to move along a steep incline, defined as 45 degrees or more. Encumbrance penalties apply to Climb checks. Rock climbing is often included in dreaded 'team building retreats'.

**Intimidate**

An Intimidate check is used when a character wishes to make another character comply to their wishes through use of a physical threat. See also 'Bully'.

**Jump**

A Jump check is used when a player dictates that the character will attempt to leap without touching an intervening surface. Encumbrance penalties apply to Jump checks. The distance covered will depend on the type of Jump attempted, with modifiers according to the conditions. 

**Melee**

A Melee check when a character is attempting to hit something with the fists, or use any number of hand-based weapons, all of which can be used as optional specialisations as fighting styles (e.g., brawling, swords, axe and mace etc). The Melee check is contested against the defense of the opponent and the difference is used to determine the damage caused.

> There are only a few combat skills in *Papers & Paychecks*. It's not that violent actions don't occur, they certainly do and they're dramatic enough in their own right. However the attention given to them as part of the game system is relatively reduced and proportional to their importance. 

**Swim**

A Swim check is necessary each round that a character is in water, with a successful check allowing quarter normal moving rate. A character who fails a Swim check may find themselves drowning.

### Intelligence Based Skills

There are many Intelligence based skills and they tend to have a relatively narrow focus. Intelligence-based skills have a default of -6 for the unskilled, recognising that it is far more difficult to figure out a problem from first principles in lieu of training.

**Craft (Computing)**

A Computing check is needed for sophisticated user, file operations, networking, hardware modifications, and programming. Major tasks which contain a degree of uniqueness (everything from building a high performance computing system or even formatting a new roleplaying game) should be classified as projects, and need to be carried out in strategic time.

**Craft (chemical)**

A Craft (chemical) check is used when a character is mixing chemicals. In most cases this will be for benign purposes, however a test is typically required when the character is engaging in dangerous admixture, whether at the time of production, or of application. This includes the production of acids, strong bases, drugs, and poisons. Note that this skill is the laboratory activity of producing chemicals, that is, the ability to use apparatus and follow a recipe. For the science of chemistry, see Knowledge (science - chemistry).

**Craft (pharmaceutical)**

A Craft (pharmaceutical) check is used to compound drugs, whether to produce a tablet, liquid, or even gaseous medicine. This includes the ability to dispense safe and effective dosages to aid healing, or conversely, to deliberately provide poisonous dosages. Use of this skill is effective for hospital pharmaceutical professions, clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care, veterinary pharmacy etc.

**Craft (writing)**

A Craft (writing) skill check is typically used when a character is composing an important email, 'blog, media release, advertisement, business report, research paper, as well as forms of creative fiction such as poetry, screenplays, novels etc. All of these are optional specialisations.

**Investigate**

An Investigate skill check is used to apply forensics, discover clues, and engage in analysis, removing improbable speculations by the availability of evidence. This skill also includes the ability to use a crime laboratory which can enhance the scope of available clues.

> It is a great idea for a character to make use of their Luck characteristic with the use of the Investigate skill. The need for investigation is usually is only applied when the situation and scene is sufficiently important. Given how naturally antagonistic the setting is, it is unlikely that The Boss is going to give the players any special hints to keep the story on track - going off the rails is a feature not a bug in this system.

**Knowledge (various)** 

A Knowledge skill check is used against any critical application of a theoretical knowledge. Many other skills consist of a combination of knowledge and practise ("know how"), whereas knowledge skills are a combination of theory and knowledge ("know what"). There are several knowledge skills (like Craft skills) and each have an optional specialisations. 

> The character Seth is a post-graduate health scientist. Their player, with a truly impressive 7 skill points per level, spends 1 to increase the Knowledge (Science), a required specialisation, and 2 on the optional specialisations of biology and medicine i.e., Knowledge (Science, Biology), Knowledge (Science, Medicine), and 1 on medical practitioners i.e., Knowledge (Science, Medics).

**Knowledge (Arts)** 

A Knowledge (Arts - specialisation) skill check is used whenever a character wishes to evaluate aesthetic expressions. This will includes knowledge of medium (literature, film, painting, sculpture, music, architecture), styles (modernism, neoclassical, baroque, medieval), and institutions (schools, suppliers, galleries), and people (artists, agents, collectors, academics).

**Knowledge (Laws)** 

A Knowledge (Laws - specialisation) skill check is used whenever a character wishes to evaluate normative regulations. This includes legal principles and systems (natural law, torts, contracts, criminal), political ideologies (anarchism, communism, socialism, liberalism, conservativism, fascism), moral theories (divine command, utilitarianism, institutions (courts, assemblies), and people (lawyers, politicians, police, academics).

**Knowledge (Sciences)**

A Knowledge (Sciences - specialisation) skill check is required whenever a character wishes to evaluate objective facts. This includes broad scientific disciplines, both physical and social (biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, economics, medicine, sociology, history, psychology), institutions (research bodies, universities), and people (various scientists according to broad discipline). Note that first aid is covered by the Survival skill.  

**Knowledge (Philosophy)**

A Knowledge (Philosophy - specialisation) skill check is required whenever a character wishes to evaluate rational propositions and evidence. This includes issues of ontology (theories of being), epistemology (theories of knowledge), logic (mathematics, rhetoric), the various institutions, schools of thought, and people.

**Knowledge (General)**

A Knowledge (General - specialisation) skill check is required whenever a character wishes to evaluate general statesments about particular places, people, institutions etc. This skill can be specialised for area knowledges (particular regions) and social classes (high society, streetwise).

**Language (various)**

A Language (specialisation) skill check is required when conversing in a language, but also applying the game system rules of when checks should be made - that is, only if the characters are rushed in their communication and there are dramatic reasons for the test, whether resulting from success or failure. A language is a required specialisation. Closely related languages will have a close default with each other.

### Wisdom Based Skills

There are a few Wisdom based skills and they tend to have an average focus. Wisdom-based skills have a default of -4 for the unskilled, existing in the middle of influence of natural ability and training.

**Administration**

An Administration check is made when testing a character's ability to organise, understand, and keep records. The operations of a modern bureaucracy are fraught with disaster without skilled administrators. This includes financial records, personell records, logistics, and time management, all of which are available as optional specialisations.

**Concentration**

A Concentration skill check is made when a character has to either shrug off the effects of temporary distractions (tactical concentration) or ignore the effects of fatigue (strategic concentration). An optional specialisation is allowed for the two time scales.

**Gamble**

A Gamble skill check is made to test a character's understanding of chance, risk, and contingency. Not only does it apply to their evaluation of traditional games of chance, but also risk management in operations and projects in a contemporary work environment, and financial investments.

**Hobby**

A Hobby skill or knowledge is a non-professional activity which a character engages in whilst not in their place of employment (e.g., arguing on the Internet, bee-keeping, game design, wine-tasting). It cannot be used as a replacement for an existing skill or knowledge, and by definition, represents an amateur activity. Hobby skills require a specialisation.

**Profession**

A Profession skill check is made to indicate how well a character satisfies the job requirements that are not directly related to the skill or knowledge of their profession. That is, their attention to their KPIs, being a 'team player', application of office occupational health and safety, knowledge of organisational structure, pay grades and promotional criteria.

**Survival**

A Survival skill check is made whenever a character is unable to access shelter and nutrition a manner mediated by position or finance. In other words, they're not renting but squatting, and not buying food, but scrounging and scavanging food. The most application of the skill in *Papers & Paychecks* is in the urban environment, it can also be used for various wilderness settings (grasslands, desert, ocean, woodlands, jungle). All of these are optional  specialiations. In all cases, Survival includes first aid knowledge. Most workplaces are required to have a designated qualified first aid officer

### Dexterity Based Skills

There are several Dexterity based skills and they tend to have an average focus. Dexterity-based skills have a default of -4 for the unskilled, existing in the middle of influence of natural ability and training, except for the Craft skills which are at -6, as component knowledge is required.

**Craft (electronic)**

A Craft (electronic) skill check is used to build and repair electronic equipment assuming component materials (vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits etc),  including audio-visual equipment, timers, radio and television equipment, information processing switches, and signal processing, all of which can be taken as optional specialisations.

**Craft (mechanical)**

A Craft (mechanic) skill check is used to build and repair mechanical equipment, that is, machinery based on the behaviour of physical bodies when subjected to forces and displacements. This includes automatic machinery, boilers, air conditioning and refrigeration, aircraft, and various mills, of which can be taken as optional specialisations.

**Craft (structural)**

A Craft (structural) skill check is used when a character is producing various items related to the home, building and construction industry from various materials including wood, metal, plastic, or concrete. It includes various furnishings and fittings, structural painting, plastering, tiling, cement laying, plumbing, and building electrics, all of which can be taken as optional specialisations.

**Craft (visual art)**

A Craft (visual art) skill check is used when a character is engaging in the production, repair, or restoration of items of fine art through an object medium (i.e., excluding acting, music, etc). This includes painting, jewellery, sculpture, and video, all of which can be taken as optional specialisations.

**Firearms**

A Firearms skill check is used whenever a character uses a portable barrelled weapon that launches projectiles with powered force which invariably operates by pointing and the weapon at the target and releasing with a trigger. There are optional specialisations for handguns, rifles, and even esoteric anachronisms such as muskets and crossbows. {what about tasers?}

**Gymnastics**

A Gymnastics skill check is used when a character is engaging in any unusual bodily maneuvers with an emphasis on flexibility. This includes feats of acrobatics, contortions, balance, tumbling, trapeze, and vaulting, all of which can be taken as optional specialisations.

**Missiles**

A Missiles skill check is used when a character is using any muscle-power missile weapon and using hand-eye co-ordination. This includes thrown objects, javelins and spears, and bows, all of which can be taken as optional specialisations.

**Pilot**

A Pilot skill check is used when a character is operating a vehicle. Typically this is for cars, motorcyles, or boats but could include carts, airplanes, ships, and spacecraft etc. Specialisation is required, but there is close association between similar vehicles.

**Ride**

A Ride skill check is used when a character is operating an animal as a mount, or operating a human-powered vehicle (the "animal" is the driver). This usually means a horse or camel, or more rarely elephants. Despite popular culture references it usually doesn't include bears or dire wolves. Specialisation is required, but there is an association between similar mounts. Note that this is a fairly rare skill amont modern office-workers.

**Sleight**

A Sleight skill check is used when a character is engaging is various acts that use both deception and fine-finger control; this includes various stage magic tricks, palming objects, pickpocketing, and slipping rats into lab-coat pockets. In an office setting often used to "borrow" staplers and other high value stationary.

**Stealth**

A Stealth skill check is used when a character is hiding in broom closets, stalking, or shadowing other characters or even animals. Note that for Stealth activities the inverse of the STR modifier is also often applied. The smaller you are the easier the skill and vice-versa.

### Perception Based Skills

There are few Perception based skills, but they have a wide application. Perception-based skills have a default of -2 for the unskilled, recognising that these skills are heavily influenced by the physical ability of the character.

**Insight**

An Insight skill check is made when a character is trying to apply their powers of cognition to information received in order to derive additional information. It is absolutely essential various types of deductive investigation. 

**Sense (type)**

A Sense skill check is made when a character applies their senses to make an evaluation of the objective world. Specialisations are required for the broad traditional sense categories Smell/Taste, Sight, Hearing, and Touch. Other creatures (and 'monsters') may have more exotic senses.

### Charisma Based Skills

There are few Charisma based skills, but they have a wide application. Charisma-based skills have a default of -2 for the unskilled, recognising that these skills are heavily influenced by the natural ability of the character.

**Act**

An Act skill check is made when a character attempts to take on a role and pretend to be someone with different motivations and interests than what is truly their own. This is often a professional skill in its own right, and is usually applied strategically rather than tactically (which differentiates it from Lie).

**Carousing**

A Carousing skill check is made when a character is engaging in imbibing in intoxicating drinks and other recreational pharmaceuticals, dancing like nobody is watching, and generally being the life of party. An essential skill for making the most of conference networking opportunities.
 
**Bully**

A Bully skill check is made when a character attempts to make another character or characters comply with threats, stated or implied. Bullying is significantly more difficult if the bullier lacks social position or is attempted against a group of people. In the *Papers & Paychecks* world this skill is frequently used by work-place superiors.

**Inspire**

An Inspire skill check is made when a character uses oratory and leadership to encourage others to engage in an activity. Whilst carried out tactically, the effects are strategic. The past successes of an Inspire skill check are important in determining success among the same individuals or group.

**Lie**

A Lie skill check is an attempt to mislead whether by blather, emphasis, omission, or contradiction of the facts. The more believable the lie is, based on plausibility and consistency, the more likely it is to succeed. The reputation and previous experience of a character to the liar also modifies their chance to succeed. A character who has personally suffered at the hands of a liar due to one of their lies (i.e., has taken physical, social, or mental damage in the past) will be "deeply suspicious" of the liar.

**Seduce**

> "Challenge, and not desire, lies at the heart of seduction.", Jean Baudrillard, *The Ecstasy of Communication*, 1987

A Seduce skill check is made when a character wishes to lead another character astray (Latin: *seducere* "to lead astray"). This typically means to persuade the other character to engage in sexual behaviour, but the same skill can be used for bribery or other dereliction of duty as seduction involves significant use of metaphor and enticement. Similarly, inducing another to consume too many beverages at the office Christmas party would be another use of this skill.

## 1.7 Perks

**Apprentice**

With the Apprentice perk, a character has assigned to them a 1st level character of the same profession. The Apprentice will be mostly loyal and mostly enthusiastic, carrying out the tasks allocated to them by the main character. Each time the Apprentice advances a level, a check with a target number of 11 is required, adding the character's CHA modifier. If failed, the Apprentice has spread their wings and found a new employer.

**Augury**

With the Augury perk a character can seemingly predict the future. In reality it is the result of careful research, planning, and insight. After a successful strategic research check, a character with an Augury perk can also predict upcoming critical disasters and weaknesses up to six strategic turns ahead.

**Bureaucratic Dodge**

With the Bureaucratic Dodge perk, the character can avoid red tape. Three times each project the character has the capacity to simply avoid any administrative or organisational blocker within their own organisation and move to their next contact or obtain the appropriate documentation etc, through the use of a particular organisational rules (e.g., invoking an occupational health and safety clause, a fire regulation, workplace equity policies, etc.)

**Conference Attendance**

With the Conference Attendance perk once per project a character may attend an expenses paid (accommodation, flight, meals) international conference. Depending on the subject matter the Conference will provide all of the following: a +1 bonus to skill checks made in the current project that are relevant from the conference subject, a contact, plus one item of new equipment from a trade stand valued no more than $1000. Note that the conference subject is determined before the project. 

> Watch this one; whilst normally it is a matter for the player to determine what the conference was, along with the contact and equipment, The Boss might intervene and determine these. This is typically a good thing as it means that the character will have a necessary role in the plot. Alternatively The Boss could be invoking a particularly nasty consequence. 

**Chutzpah**

The Chutzpah perk enables the character to turn social attacks into an audacious defense. A successful social attack by a character with this perk not only damages the target but also provides temporary social hit points (for the duration of the conflict) equivalent to the base damage caused.

**Cramming**

By spending two strategic turns researching a particular topic a character may gain the equivalent of +1 skill point in a skill or knowledge. The skill point fades from memory 48 hours (12 strategic turns) after being acquired.

**Department Manager**

The Department Manager enables the character to have CHA+Level-3 *teams* assigned to them, in the same manner as the Team Leader. Each team provides an extra 10% bonus to the base pay.

> What? Did you seriously expect that you'd become the head of the company? Ha! You work for forty years of your life and you'll get to be Vice-President. No further.

**Ego Whip**

With the Ego Whip perk the character gains the ability to creatively to identify and attack the character's sense of conscious self, generating a sense of worthlessness and despair in the target. A character who invokes this attack gains a +3 bonus in social combat, and leaves the character physically stunned for one tactical round. It may only be used once per target, per encounter. The attack counts as an action.

**Intellect Fortress**

With the Intellect Fortress perk the character gains bonus hit points equal to their best skill level (not including characteristics) and distributed equally between the social, mental, and physical hit points. These cannot be healed, are the first points which are removed as a result of combat, but can "regenerate" between projects. They represent an force of will based on the character's own extended sense of self - and that can be chipped away by others.

**Id Insinuation**

With the Id Insinuation perk the character gains the ability to question the motives of an opposing character suggesting that they are being inspired by base desires, leading to an internal moral response of the opposing character against themselves. A character who invokes this attack gains a +2 bonus in social combat. It may only be used once per target, per encounter. The attack counts as an action.

**Intellect Fortress**

With the Intellect Fortress perk the character protects themselves by asserting the security of their mind through their knowledge and an inspiring speech. Following a two action spoken invocation of the Intellect Fortress, all allied characters (i.e., those with a common objective) receive a +2 bonus against mental and social attacks for two strategic turns.

**Intuition**

With the Intuition perk the character has the uncanny ability of being able to guess correctly, or at least be able to to subconsciously process information quicker. In any situation where they are confronted with electing from two choices they gain a +2 bonus in selecting the most optimal, and in a situation with three choices they gain a +1 bonus. There is no bonus for options of four or more choices.

**File System Knowledge**

The File system Knowledge perk provide the character the physical and virtual organisation of documents and objects. A character with file system knowledge knows where last year's invoice to the insurance company is located, where the snacks are stashed, and where the optical time-delay spectrometer is (even if they don't know what said item does). This additionally provides a +2 bonus for research and perception skill checks in their current place of employment and a +1 bonus in prior places of employment. 

**Laboratory Equipment**

The Laboratory Equipment perk enables the character to have access to appropriate specialist equipment, such as vacuum ovens, PET scanners, qPCR thermocyclers, cell culture incubators, microscopes, laboratory glassware, autoclaves, chemicals (especially reagents) and biological safety cabinets. Some skills, such as Craft (chemical) and Craft (pharmaceutical), are not possible without access to a laboratory.

**Library Access**

Acquiring public library access is something that everyone can do; but the Library Access perk is a collection of unusual rights, that provides for a wider scale of information, restricted borrowings, and additional assistance from library staff. The Library Access perk provide an additional +2 bonus to research and other information gathering tasks when the character uses a library. 

**Magic Missile**

The Magic Missile perk is the ability of a character to succeed in either a Knowledge or Craft skill, depending on Profession (Researcher or Tradesperson, respectively). The character will receive level-5 magic missiles per strategic turn, which will result in an automatic '12' to their die roll. This represents that at sometime in the past the character has researched exactly this subject or carried out this particular practical task.

**Multitasking**

The Multitasking perk allows a character to carry out two mental tasks simultaneously. Whilst many characters may appear to have multitasking this is usually achieved through task-switching. Effectively multitasking provides the character with the perk an additional mental action per tactical turn.

**Parallel Processing**

The Parallel Processing perk is identical to the Multitasking perk, except the additional mental task applies for strategic turns.

**Prestidigitator**

With the Prestidigitator perk, a character has become especially skilled in matters of fine manipulation. The character gains a +2 bonus to the DEX permanently, but only for these relevant tasks (e.g., Craft skills, but not Firearms, Gymnastics etc).

**Project Manager**

The Project Manager perk enables the character to manage a project team over a period of weeks and with a budget. Like the Team Leader, the Project Manager will receive a number of characters, however their total pool of levels will be CHA+Level, and the character may select the members of their project team. Unlike the operations team (c.f., Team Leader) the project team is temporary. With the start of each new project it must be re-established. 

**Read/Write Science**

The Read/Write Science perk represents that the character has learned the art of reading and composing the arcane script of scientific language. Every profession has its own jargon of course, but only those with this this perk can write with such obfuscation that it requires a character with this perk to understand it in human terms. Note that a character with this perk does not have to write in such a manner; it is entirely optional. However it is usually required for journal publication.

**Security Access**

Security Access provides a character with the means (keys, swipe cards) to access _a_ (singular) restricted area of a place of employment. This applies to permanent, casual, and contract staff, and is particularly useful in the latter case for various forms of infiltration.

**Small Business**

The Small Business perk means that a character is sufficiently skilled in a specialist practical skill and is sufficiently well-known from previous work that they can operate their own business. They become a Boss - albeit one dependent on the requirements of others. With the Small Business perk a character's weekly income is subject to an average WIS check. For each point above the target number the character receives an additional +20% to their base pay. For each point below, the character loses 10%.

**Spurious Logic**

The Spurious Logic perk allows the character to combine their intellectual deftness with social skills, allowing for their INT and CHA bonuses to be added to any skill checks.

**Superannuation**

The Superannuation perk is the final reward of a character and is common across all character classes. The good news is that the character receives a nest egg of ten times their _base_ pay plus their characteristic bonuses (including the Wisdom bonus for prudent investments). The bad news is that this is it, you've spent your life working for the man. A character who does not reach tenth level in a profession will receive a proportional value on their highest level at retirement.

**Team Leader**

The Team Leader perk enables the character to have CHA+Level-3 other characters assigned to them in the same manner as the Apprentice perk, and subject to the same tests. As with the Apprentice the new characters in the Team are also 1st level. Note that if the modifiers reduces the number of team members to zero or less, the character receives no benefit from this perk. Each time the Team Leader character advances a level, a new 1st level character joins the team. 

**Tower of Iron Will**

With the Tower of Iron Will perk, the character ignores an uncomfortable reality through sheer willpower alone, and can ignore the effects of any wound for a period of time, as long as they make a WIS check with a target number of 11. Reality however has a harsh way of reasserting itself and the wound will take effect after two tactical turns for physical wounds, or a strategic turn for mental and social wounds.

**Union Membership**

Union membership is an important perk which equalises the labour market which is usually in favour of employers (many employees, fewer employers). This perk however represents membership of a strong union, and thus whilst many characters in *Papers & Paychecks* can get union membership (or some sort of professional association) the benefits become evident at different levels, according to profession. Union membership provides a 10% bonus to a character's wage, and a reduction in social damage attacks by co-workers (including managers) by 25%.

## 1.8 Personality

*"Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie"*
Robert Hogan

Like much of the corporate world, *Papers & Paychecks* uses the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator as a summary of a character's personality, and mapped to the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, both of which are derived from Jungian psychology. Like most aspects of roleplaying games, this is expressed in the simplified form, without auxiliary functions for example. In other games this is the equivalent of their "alignment". As a roleplaying game, a player should play according to the role of their character. 

Whilst the player is given a choice about the personality values of their Type, within the range of 3-18, and an option is designed for random generation. Note that contrary to original expectations the four dichotomies of MBTI tend towards a more normal distribution rather than a bipolar distribution. In addition the formal MBTI uses absolute values rather than a continuum.

For random generation simply roll 1d6 for each of the four personality pairs and provide a value of +1 to +3 to either Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perceiving. This can be easiest achieved by assigning +1 to +3 to first paired value when the die roll is from 1 to 3, and +1 to +3 to the second paired value when the die roll is 4 to 6. Note that this does not give the same distribution of personality traits as expected by the MBTI.

> For example: Walter's player loves random determination of traits. "Makes me feel alive!", they exclaim. "I want a *random* personality!", and rolls four 1d6 and gets 3, 4, 2, and 5. The first result is +3 Extraversion ("Oh yeah! Everyone listen to me!"), +1 to Sensing, +2 to Thinking, and +2 to Perceiving. "A Promoter! That's perfect!"  

**Favorite world: Extraversion/Introversion**

Extraversion and Introversion are preferences in MBTI, which may not map to actual activities. In a general sense, Extraverted characters are outward-focussed by preference, whereas Intraverted characters are inward-focussed by preference. This does not mean that extraverted characters necessarily prefer action to thought (or vice-versa for introverts), but rather their actions have different reasons; the extravert will think in order to engage with the external world, the introvert will act in order to engage with their inner world. 

Socially, extraverted characters are often engaged in the company of others, and are energised by social interactions, especially with a wide variety of individuals and ideas. Introverted characters prefer smaller close-knit groups, or even their own company. This should not be confused with social anxiety issues; an extraverted character could suffer from stage fright, just as an introverted person could be perfectly fine with other people; they would just *prefer* to bury their nose in a book.

**Information: Sensing/Intuition***

Sensing and Intuition are information-gathering functions in the MBTI. Again, it is a preferential model. In a general sense, Sensing characters are orientated towards giving credence to information that is immediate, empirical, and tangible, coming from their senses. In contrast Intuition characters are more trusting of information that is contextual, rational, and abstract. 

A Sensing character will prefer to recall events as a set of facts, whereas the Intuitive character will recall them as contexts and flow. Sensing characters will solve problems but each step in a serial and linear manner, whereas an Intuition character will solve problems by taking in ideas, interpretations, and possibilities from a variety of sources. Sensing and Intuition must be understood as information-gathering traits, rather than a sensual response. An Intuitive character can still be a person who enjoys physical sensation, just a Sensing character could dislike physical sensations.

**Decision: Thinking/Feeling**

Thinking and Feeling are preferential choices when making decisions in the MBTI. Characters with a Thinking preference tend to look towards internal consistency as their primary source with a degree of detached fairness, whereas characters with a Feeling preference tend towards the particular circumstances and feelings of the people involved.

Characters who prefer Thinking for decision making are not necessarily "thinkers" or more intelligent or rational, and likewise people who have Feeling for decision making are not necessarily more sensate, or even more empathic. The MBTI evaluates preferences, not ability. 

**Orientation: Judging/Perception**

Judging and Perception are preferential choices when orientating one's self to the external world. Characters with a Judging preference prefer an organised and planned approach to life that has a high degree of structure so they can be make contingencies. A Perceiving character has a preference of living that has a higher degree of flexibility and spontaneity so they can adapt to new circumstances.

Characters who prefer Judging are not necessarily judgemental, and characters who prefer Perceiving are not necessarily more perceptive. It is an expression of how one prefers to organise their interactions with the external world.

**Game Use**

With an assignment or from random determination, characters will have MBTI values for the four paired values. From here, a bonus is derived in the same manner that is done for characteristics, based on the dominant value of the pair or for the first value if the bonus is +0. When a situation arises when a preference is called (e.g., a matter of world preference, of information gathering, of decision making, of world orientation) the player may optionally roll 2d6 against a target number of 7 (easy) to *guide* their approach, adding the appropriate bonuses. The degree of 'success' above the target number establishes a commitment to a particular approach to the dominant pair, and likewise the degree of 'failure' represents a commitment to the opposite pair.

For example: Russel Wrench, a mild mannered computer programmer, has randomly determined the paired characteristics: Extraversion 6 (-2) which becomes Introversion (+2), Sensing 9 which becomes Intuition (+1), Thinking 12 (+1), and Judging 14 (+2). The player marks these scores and values in the character sheet under "Personality".

**Keirsey Temperament Sorter**

The Keirsey Temperament Sorter provides roles which can be mapped to MBTI values. These are provided here as a shortcut for players to make an "at a glance" overall decision of a character's behaviour. Kersey assessed characters on whether they were orientated by preference towards the concrete and the abstract, then whether they were cooperative or utilitarian, then informative or directive, and finally expressive or attentive. This provides multi-level temperament, role, and role variants.


| MBTI	| Kiersey Role Variant	| Kiersey Descriptives				|
|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ESFJ	| Provider		| Concrete, Logistical, Supporting, Supplying	|
| ISFJ	| Protector		| Concrete, Logistical, Supporting, Securing	|
| ESTJ	| Supervisor		| Concrete, Logistical, Regulating, Enforcing	|
| ISTJ	| Inspector		| Concrete, Logistical, Regulating, Certifying	|

| ISTP	| Crafter  		| Concrete, Tactical, Expediating, Instrumenting|
| ENFP	| Champion		| Abstract, Diplomatic, Mediating, Motivating	|
| INFP	| Healer		| Abstract, Diplomatic, Mediating, Concilliating|
| ENFJ	| Teacher		| Abstract, Diplomatic, Developing, Educating	|
| INFJ	| Counsellor		| Abstract, Diplomatic, Developing, Guiding	|
| ENTP	| Inventor		| Abstract, Rational, Costructing, Devising	|

| ENTJ	| Fieldmarshal		| Abstract, Rational,  Arranging, Mobilizing	|
| INTJ	| Mastermind		| Abstract, Rational, Arranging, Entailing	|

For example, Russel Wrench is a "Mastermind", and that is added in the the character sheet next to the personality values.

The Boss should show interest in how players use these results as it represents playing according to the character's psychological preferences. A consistent use of such character preferences by a player, especially when it is contrary to the character's interests at the time should result in a Luck Point reward.

> Boss: OK, you're in for the big technical meeting. The manager and the team are there, all NPC Workers except you. Everyone's really pumped out and excited about this new roll-out of a massive new storage system for the company, with a new operating system and storage protocol. Everyone's talking over one another, scribbling on white boards and debating what tasks they're going to do. Rodney, what's your character, Russell Wrench, up to?
> 
> Rodney: My character has Introversion at +2, I make a check and roll a ... ahh, an 12. Russell will pull out his laptop and start reading through some technical specifications for operating system and storage protocol.
> 
> Boss: Whoa, the manager is not impressed with that at all, "This is a *team* meeting Russell, your input is appreciated. A *lot* of money is being spent on this project, including a lot of money on *your* wages. We expect value for money", he says tersely.
> 
> Rodney: Russell ignores the manager for several seconds and finally mutters something about going over the technical details.
> 
> Boss: Ha! That's excellent. Give yourself a Luck Point for playing in character even when the character is under threat. The manager explodes at you, "When ask you to participate, Mr. Wrench, I am giving an *order*, not an *option*. We have come here for a team meeting to determine the roll-out of a two million dollar project, and here you are wasting company time playing around on your laptop. Either you contribute or get out of here!". The room falls silent and everyone turns looking at you. Your move.
> 
> Rodney: Huh, attack is the best defense. I initiate a social attack against the manager. I'll make a Computer roll, and spend my Luck Point to make it a 12. That's my best skill and brings it to a total of 18. What's the manager's defense?
> 
> Boss: Er, well, he's really set himself up for this, so I guess it's a counter-attack with Bully! His bonus is +5 total and he rolls a, ahh, 5, for a total of 10. You win by 8 points, that's a huge loss to his Charisma, even with his professional defense it'll take him months to recover. OK, what do you do?
> 
> Rodney: Russell closes the lid of his laptop, gets up, and says, "The operating system and the storage protocol are incompatible". He glares at the manager. "I've just saved the company two million dollars - and saved your job", and then walks out the door.
> 
> Boss: Drops mic, eh?
> 
> Rodney: *nods* Drops mic.

# 2.0 Actions and The Environment

## 2.1 Time and Core Mechanic

A brief reiteration of the core mechanic is provided here: 2d6 plus modifiers versus a target number for dramatic actions or a flat 7 plus modifiers versus a target number for prosaic actions. The target number is either determined in a quick method, as provided in section 0.4, _or_ in a detailed method, with modifiers described in this chapter. Do not use both at the same time.

Character actions occur in either a tactical or strategic time-frame. The former is for immediate and quick actions that can be carried out in ten-seconds. The latter is for involved actions carried out over a four-hour time-frame. This implies two tactical actions per shift in a workday (morning and afternoon) with a brief lunch-break in between, or equivalent for night-shift workers.

## 2.2 The Resistentialist Environment

**Alcohol**

A character may drink a quarter of their STR in as standard doses with no immediate ill-effects. For example, a standard dose of alcohol is 10 grams, approximately 250ml of beer, 125ml of wine, or a 30ml nip of high strength spirits. If the number of standard doses exceeds this value, they must make a STR characteristic test with a target number of 7. If they fail, they will feel nauseous, but with no additional effects. Regardless of whether they fail or succeed, they will gain a temporary bonus of +1 CHA, representing a lowering of internal social barriers.

For each multiple of the calculated STR value (i.e., .25 STR, .50 STR, 1.00 STR,  1.25 STR etc.) an additional roll is required, with an increase of +2 per increase (i.e., 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 etc). At this stage all skill and characteristic checks will also be at -2 per multiple. A second fail will cause the character to get sick, and, if they insist on drinking, a third roll will lead them to pass out. At the point of the second roll, the character gains a total of +2 CHA, and should make a personality check to determine whether they are going to be a lively and social, or sombre and contemplative; they will also be at -2 to resisting social influence checks.

> "That was so wrong" 
> Princess Leia, lying in bed with Luke Skywalker, in Robot Chicken: Star Wars, 2007

It is, of course, quite possible for a character to drink so fast that they ingest several multiples of alcohol simultaneously, and thus may have to make multiple tests of their degree of alcohol poisoning (or a fiendish individual may force additional alcohol into a person who has already passed out). The fourth to sixth failed checks indicate temporarily waking prior to vomiting, and the eighth and ninth failures indicate vomiting *without* waking. If this occurs they'd better have some friends nearby, otherwise they will be subject to the "Drowning and Suffocation" rules, in addition to taking 1d6 damage per failure due to alcoholic poisoning. This is a method of acquiring permanent fame by some in the music industry. 

A character's effective dosage is reduced by 1 per hour that they do not consumer further alcohol. A character who has failed at least two rolls from a session and then sleeps will be subject to a hangover, unless they undertake sufficient precautions (e.g., a litre of water, 2 paracetamol, and a multivitamin is recommended). If a character has a hangover they must make a standard characteristic roll or be sick as per a second failure. They will also suffer a -2 to all skill rolls for the remainder of the day.
 
**Drowning and Suffocation**

A character's capacity to hold their breath is equal to twice their Constitution score; if they engage in any actions whilst in this situation that counts as an additional round's worth (so an active character can only hold their breath for half as long), exertion is four times the at-rest consumption, and maximum exertion is eight times. Once the character is out of breath, they must make a Constitution characteristic test with a target number of 5, and increasing one per round. If the Constitution check is failed, they fall unconscious (dropping to zero hit points immediately), and will lose one hit point every round from then on. Water is not the only substance a character can drown in. A character can drown in sand, mud, snow, grain etc. Most appropriately, circumstances may occur where a character drowns in paperwork. *Wouldn't that be ironic?*

Gradual suffocation uses similar rules to drowning. If there is no availability of air, use the same rules as above. If the body is in an enclosed space the process will be slower. A person trapped in a coffin or a sealed stationary cabinet for example will use up their oxygen supply in approximately five and a half hours. The boot of a car is not sealed so suffocation would not apply, unless the boot has been especially designed to be airtight, and cars themselves are not airtight either. For places that are airtight, multiply the example of the stationary cabinet according to volume. An alternative is the replacement of the existing air supply in a vehicle or other enclosed space (e.g., supplying carbon monoxide to a car). This typically takes several minutes, then apply the general rules for drowning. 

**Falling**

If a character falls each second after that they may attempt at a -5 DEX test to stabilise themselves and grab onto something (i.e., at 5m, 20m, 125m). That 'something', if they fail, will probably be the big and friendly ground. Being attached by a rope to something stable is advisable when climbing any significant distance. 

**Other Drugs**

> "Drug addiction is the attempt to obliterate one's consciousness, the quest for a deliberately-induced insanity. As such, it is so obscene and evil that any doubt about the moral character of its practitioners is itself an obscenity."
> Ayn Rand, Apollo and Dionysus, 1969. Ms Rand consistently used amphetamines from 1942 to 1972.

Similar rules for alcohol also apply to other drugs, that is, there is a standard dose and a constitution break-point at .25 STR, .50 STR, .75 STR, etc, with target number checks at 7, 9, 11 etc. Broad categoies are provided here for "up, down, and sideways", and the Boss should note the typical differences in strength between various versions of the same general drug type and differences in delivery methods, and perscription versus street purity and dosage.

*Amphetamines, Cocaine and Other 'Uppers'*. Therapeutic doses (up to a quarter of a character's STR) are used to stabilise moods, provide alertness, and treat obesity. At this level a character receives +1 INT and suffers no ill short-term effects. From a quarter to a half of their STR in dosage, the character also gains an additional temporary +1 STR and will have an additional strategic move of wakefulness, which will require an additional strategic move of sleep after the effect wears off. *Burn tomorrow's energy today*. An additional strategic action from half to equal to their STR in dosage, then two times their STR, four times, and so on.

If a character has more than a quarter of their STR in doses, they must make a STR check. A failed check represents nervousness, changes in libido (either increased or reduced, equal chance of either), and increased confidence. A second failed check results in irritability, obsessiveness, and grandiosity, resulting in -1 CHA. A third and fourth failed check indicates an increasingly cumulative effect to negative CHA, as delusions, auditory hallucinations, and paranoia becomes prevalent. Failed checks beyond this represents cardiovascular physical damage of 1d6 per failure, and psychosis of 1d6 mental damage per failure. 

*Cannabis, Mescaline, LSD, and other 'Sideways'* Therapeutic doses (up to a quarter of a character's STR) of psychoactives are used for anti-nausea and sometimes psychotherapeutic experiments. Given that powerful psychoactives are almost invariably illegal medical research and use is proportionally rare. At a therapeutic dose, the character gains 1d6 points of healing of mental damage and experiences euphoria. From a quarter to a half of their STR in dosage, the character can gain an additional 1d6 of mental damage or suffer 1d6 mental damage (equal chance of either), but will also experiences hallucinations. Increased doses (at three quarters and equal to the characters STR) has the same cumulative effect. Beyond that, there is no additional effect.

*Heroin, Opiates, Barbiturates, and other 'Downers'* Therapeutic doses (up to a quarter of a character's STR) are used to provide for pain relief and palliative care, with the immediate side-effects of euphoria and calmness. At this level a character can ignore the physical effects of up to half their STR in damage, and gains +1 WIS and +1 manual DEX with steadiness. From a quarter to a half of their STR in dosage, the character can ignore the effects of up to their STR in damage, and also gains an additional temporary +1 WIS. There is no additional benefit from further dosage.

If a character has more than a quarter of their STR in doses, they must make a STR check. A failed check represents nausea, vomiting, and stumbling with -2 DEX. A second failed causes immobility as the character collapses in place. A third failed introduces stupor, being unable to move or react, a fifth unconsciousness, a sixth a deep unconsciousness with a medical skill is required to revive the character and eighth and additional failed checks resulting in coronary failure with 1d6 physical damage.

## 2.3 Tactical Task Resolution

**General**

A tactical round is a period of six seconds. It is used fo dramatic actions where immediate time as of the essence which includes, as per the great time-honoured tradition of roleplaying games, of physical conflict. Each tactical round's activity begins with the character with the highest initiative score, based on their Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charism as appropriate to their action, and then proceeds in order to the lowest. A tactical round should be perceived as an abstract method for organising time and the sequence of action declarations when, of course, activity occurs in a continuous rate.

A character typically may take two 'standard actions' in a tactical round. A standard action usually means make a skill roll or a move. In addition to standard actions there are short actions. A 'short action' is something that is performed quickly and can be combined with a standard action (e.g., get a something out of your pocket whilst taking a move action). A character is limited to two short actions per standard action, plus the character's DEX bonus. If the DEX bonus reduces this quantity to less to 0 or less then the character may has to count short actions as standard actions; all other things being equal this would only occur if the character has a DEX of 5 or less. Finally, there is a small number of actions ('free actions') which effectively take no time at all (e.g., drop an item).

**Tactical Conflict**

Tactical conflict is initiated when a character (PC or NPC) declares it as such. Other characters present may make a Perception skill check with a target number of 11 in standard situations; those that succeed make act as per normal on that tactical round and all subsequent rounds. Those that fail will have that number subtracted from their initial defense check (which is also usually based on Brawl). A character receives one standard action at 5 points or less of Dexterity, Wisdom, or Charisma (depending on whether it is a physical, mental, or social conflict), two from 6 to 15, three from 16 to 25 etc, and an equal number of defensive reactions.  

The difference between the attack action and the defensive reaction provides a margin of success or failure. The weapon used provides a multiplier to the damage inflicted. From this number armour is subtracted, defining the damage inflicted.

Characters may declare a variety of basic tactical maneuvers. These include:

* Normal attack, normal defense.
* Damaging attack, +1x damage, x0.5 defense.
* Defensive stance, no attack, x1.5 defense. 
* Beserk attack, x1.5 attack, x0.5 defense. 
* Damage reduction, x0.5 attack, -1x damage.
 
A defensive stance effectively uses a standard action to add to the character's defense. Note that in most cases damage received in tactical conflict is mental or social bruising (shock or embarrassment). Physical damage can be bruises or wounds, depending on the damage.

**Bully**

A successful Bully check, contested by an opponent's Wisdom check, persuades another character to behave in a certain way by use of real or implied threats. The ability to Bully is significantly altered by the quantity of people that the attempt is applied against (individuals in a group get their own check and a bonus for being part of a group), the demanded action, and the position of the attacker. An interesting aspect of the Bully skill is that whilst it is tactical, the effects are strategic and ablative; an additional Wisdom check, at +1 per strategic turn of work, is allowed, until the bullied target succeed. A single check is made for the number of consecutive standard actions taken on a Bully check.

1 standard action of Bullying -2 
2 standard actions of Bullying -1
4 standard actions of Bullying +0
6 standard actions of Bullying +1
8 standard actions of Bullying +2
10 standard actions of Bullying +3
12 standard actions of Bullying +4

Single target +0
Two targets -1
Three targets -2
Four targets -3
etc

Bully in superior position in organisation +0
Bully in direct managerial position over target +2
Bully in inferior position in organisation -4
Bully not in organisation +0 (must use external threats)
Bully in a position to use or threaten violence +4

**Brawl**

Brawl is a context combat skill. When a character announces a Brawl in almost all cases they are attempting to apply physical violence to their opponent. When a character carries out a Brawl attack, the defender may react and defend themselves also with a Brawl check. The difference between the two values equals the amount of damage caused, modified by the weapon. 

**Climb**

There is a modifier to the climb check depending on the angle of the incline. Handholds are *required* for any incline of 90 degrees or more.

50 degrees to 59 degrees: +2
60 degrees to 69 degrees: +1
70 degrees to 79 degrees: +0
80 degrees to 89 degrees: -1
90 degrees to 109 degrees: -2 
110 degrees to 139 degrees: -3
140 degrees to 180 degrees: -4

There are also modifiers on the type of surface:

Smooth worked material with no handholds: -4
Rough surface, such as a crumbling building or natural rock: -2
Very rough surface with handholds and footholds (e.g., rope, etc): +0
Normal climbable surface (e.g., rigging, tree etc): +2
A ladder on a stable surface: +4 

The width of the surface that the character is climbing also modifies the chance.

More than 30cm wide: +0
More than 10cm, less than 30cm: -2
Less than 10cm: -4

A character with one limb missing or unavailable has a penalty of -2 for climbing, and -4 for two limbs missing (it is difficult, but far from impossible for a paraplegic to climb). 

If the character has a critical success they can move up to 1/2 their normal speed. If they succeed, or succeed with consequences, they can move at 1/4 of their normal rate. If they fail, they do not move at all. If they critically fail, they will fall (see Falling, 2.2). 

A character's Dexterity whilst climbing for the purpose of avoidance (such as dodging), is equal to the movement modifiers given above (e.g., a character who is moving at 1/4 of their normal Speed will have 1/4 of their normal Dexterity; this will usually mean that they are quite an easy target).

A character may attempt to catch an falling object (e.g., another character) whilst climbing. This requires a successful Brawl action against the Dexterity-based velocity of the falling object and its size as elaborated in the physical combat rules. However if the total weight exceeds the Encumbrance limit of the character they will also require a Climb check.

If a character takes physical damage whilst climbing, they will need to make a Concentration skill roll with a modifier equal to the damage taken. If the roll is failed another Climb skill roll is required for that round.

If the equipment is availble, a character may attempt to improve the surface they are climbing by making additional handholds. For every six rounds of using hammer and pitons, or ice-picks, or similar, they may improve the bonus by +1 for every metre of movement. 

**Computing**

The difficulty of a Computing check depends on the activity being carried out.

| Target Number	| Example	|
|---------------|---------------|
| 7 		| Use a word processor effectively, use simple commands, attach a peripheral.	|
| 9 		| Basic use of spreadsheet, simple use of a database, use options to commands, insert a internal card. |
| 11 		| Apply simple formulae in a spreadsheet or database, write a simple script, use complex commands, compile a simple program, troubleshoot a failed network connection, bypass an insecure computer system |
| 13 		| Write a complex spreadsheet or database query, write a complex script, compile a program with depedencies, network an office and peripherals, build a PC from components, determine basic security flaws in an unpatched operating system. | 
| 15 		| Exploit basic security flaws, identity complex security flaws | 
| 17		| Exploit complex security flaws	|

The number of standard actions taken to carry out an activity very much depends on the scale and complexity of the task. For example, finding a file or keyphrase in a collection of files is either very easy or easy, and will remain of that difficulty regardless of the scale; it is the time that may be of an issue. Conducting such a search on a personal computer (laptop or desktop) will take 3 standard actions, on a small office network of it would take several standard actions, for a large corporate network anywhere up to 1000 standard actions or more. Note however that just a single roll is required; the time taken is the processing of the search; assume two standard actions to type the command, and then one standard action per personal directory for the processing of a command.

Another common activity, especially from player characters, is attempts to bypass computer security. This can be achieved through two basic methods. The first, heavily emulated in various roleplaying games, is to find flaws in the operating system which can be exploited. Whilst it depends on the operating system and how regularly it is patched, the general level of difficulty is quite high. The second, an easier method in many ways, is various forms of social engineering and trickery against users. In this case the exploit depends on how careful the user in question is. Typically user passwords can be obtained from either through brute force, educated guesses, or a well-timed wrench-blow to sensitive areas of their anatomy.

[[img src=https://xkcd.com/538/]]

**Jump**

Jump is heavily modified by the velocity of the character from the round prior to jumping. A velocity of 0m/round equates with a standing jump.

| Velocity	| Modifier	|
|---------------|---------------|
| 0m/round	| -4		|
| 4m/round	| -2		|
| 8m/round	| +0		|
| 12m/round	| +2		|
| 16m/round	| +4		|
| etc		| etc		| 

For a long jump, a horizontal move, the distance is equal to the result in metres. At the midpoint of the jump, the character will have a vertical height of equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. For a high jump, a vertical move, the distance jumped is equal to one quarter of the result in meters. 

This table and description can also be used for characters who find themselves in an unexpected aerial velocity. "Jumping" sometimes is not entirely voluntary.

**Fire**

Use of the DEX-based Firearms skill (section 1.6) governs the base chance for firearms. Firearms have a base range which indicates a normal to hit chance. In addition there is a point-blank range up to PER in meters which receives a +2 bonus to hit, and a long range up to double the base range which carries a -2 penalty and an extreme range which is at -4. There is also scale and speed modifiers; a character with a STR (for SIZ) of less than 5, receives a benefit of -2 to hit for each point below 5. From 5-15 there is no change, and from 16 upwards, there is a +2 bonus to hit for every 10 points.

A semi-automatic fire action allows three bullets per action at -1 to the skill roll. A burst fire action releases five rounds, at -2 to hit per five rounds, per action. Burst fire mode a firearm can conduct a spray attack against multiple targets, at -2 per additional target, and with 1 round lost per 5m seperation between the targets.

Shooting a target is a contested skill against a defense roll, with bonus for the speed or actions of the character, partially represented by their DEX bonus. There bonus depending on the degree of cover that a character has afforded themselves as a result of any Move actions or existing position: +8 bonuse if they are almost entirely behind cover, +6 for exposure of head or similar, +4 for head, shoulders, and chest, and +2 for half-cover (such as crouching, kneeling). A character who is attacked with surprise has an effective DEX of 0, which represents a -5 penalty. 

**Lie**

> "He offered alternative facts"   
> Kellyanne Conway denies Trump press secretary lied   
> https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/23/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts-lies

A character must make a Lie check each round each time that they tell another character something that they know is untrue, or they withhold information which they believe is pertinent. The ability of a character to tell a lie depends on the plausibility of the lie (often subjective to the target) and the target's gullibility. Lying is a contested skill, against the target's Insight, however this skill begins with a -4 penalty. A handful of people have the perceptive ability to truly pick up on the unconscious nonverbal communication (kinesics) when one is being told a lie. This ability is incorporated into the Perception score. Cleverly applied, a lie can a very powerful tool in physical, social, or mental combat.

| Plausibility							| Modifier	|
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| The lie is believable and doesn't affect the target. 		| +0		|
| The lie is a little hard to believe or puts the target at risk. | 	-2	|
| The lie is implausible or is very risky for the target.	| 	-4	|
| The lie is extremely implausible, almost impossible 		| -6		|

| Gullibility							| Modifier	|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| The target wants to believe the liar.				| +2		|
| The target is suspicious of the liar. 			| -2		|
| The target is deeply suspicious of the liar.			| -4		|

**Swim**

A character must make a Swim check each round while they are in water. A successful check will allow the character to move at one quarter of their normal rate. A failure without consequences means that they have made no progress, and a failure with consequences means that they are beginning to drown.

Target numbers for Swim checks depend on the ferocity of the water, which is measured by the Douglas Scale. This is  also called the "international sea and swell scale", and was devised in the 1920s by Captain H.P. Douglas of the Royal Navy, who knew a little bit about the subject. The Target Number starts with a  base of 5, and increases by an additional +2 per level on the Scale up to moderate, then +3 after that.

| Target Number	| Douglas Scale	| Wave Height	| Description	|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|	5	|	0 	| no wave 	| Calm (Glassy)	|
|	7	|	1 	| 0–0.10 	| Calm (rippled) |
|	9	|	2 	| 0.10–0.50 	| Smooth	|
|	11	|	3 	| 0.50–1.25 	| Slight	|
|	13	|	4 	| 1.25–2.50 	| Moderate	|
|	15	|	5 	| 2.50–4.00	| Rough		|
|	18	|	6 	| 4.00–6.00 	| Very rough	|
|	21	|	7 	| 6.00–9.00 	| High		|
|	24	|	8 	| 9.00–14.00 	| Very high	|
|	27	|	9 	| 14.00+ 	| Phenomenal	|

If a character's head is underwater they begin to drown. See Section 2.2 for the unfortunate effects of Drowning. Note for Boss; if the weather is right, water roughness is known to change quite quickly, especially at sea. 


## 2.4 Strategic Task Resolution

**General**

A strategic turn is a period of around four hours. It is used for non-immediate actions where various actions such as planning, treachery, research etc are carried out. Because the actions are non-immediate, initiative scores are not usually required. A tactical turn should be perceived as an abstract method for organising longer-term action declarations. Note that the workday includes two strategic actions, punctuated by a lunch-break. Normally The Boss will request actions on the "morning turn" and the "afternoon turn". 

**Strategic Conflict**

One very important aspect of strategic conflict is that it is typical way that wounds are caused in social or mental conflict, whether initiated through gossip, investigation, or carefully-crafted psychological damage. Whereas the difference between "bruises" and "wounds" with physical damage depends much more on the weapon, with mental and social attacks it is usually time-dependent. 

**Analysis, Research, and Synthesis**

The usual trajectory of an investigation is research first, analysis, and finally synthesis. This process can occur across a range of disciplines (business, science, language, literature, mathematics, music etc). *Research* is the ability to acquire information, and usually depends on whether the character has an appropriate skill to the subject being researched. *Analysis* is the ability to break up a complex problem or issue into its components and to illustrate the relationship between the components. *Synthesis* is the ability to make insightful discovery from the analysis, or invent new relationships.

When approached as a strategic task, The Boss may decide for simple actions (e.g., one that takes only a single strategic turn), that a single skill check be taken, whether by the skill in question (to represent research), or with Investigate or Insight (to represent analysis or synthesis). Otherwise The Boss should consider the individual components and complexity of the research chain, which can vary. For example, data acquisition might be difficult, (e.g., requiring 4 strategic turns and a high target number), the analysis however could be easy (e.g., a single strategic turn, and a low target number), and the synthesis of average complexity (e.g., a single turn, average target number). 

As with other skill checks in *Papers & Paychecks*, the closeness of a the final value of a check to the target number represents the relative degree of success. It is possible to *almost* receive the information required, or receive it with some flaws, or even, if the roll is good enough, to receive all the information and receive additional and beneficial news.

The technical and office resources available can also modify the time and difficulty significantly, even to the point of making it impossible. A character's research can only be as good as the resources they have available; analysis tools can provide a significant reduction in time (e.g., big data analytics). Synthesis is really a creative process, but can be enhanced by several characters - only if they understand the analysis - participating and bouncing ideas off each other. The assignment of time and target numbers. The overall point is to treat research, analysis, and synthesis as plot contributions, and the means to spur the PC Workers to action. 

**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a series of psychological attacks against an individual group designed to bring them to doubt their own memory, perception, and sanity. The in practise techniques are varied, but specific examples are from the 1938 play and 1944 film adaption from where the activity gets its name. In game terms it is abstracted by the use of any Charisma skill that could be used for manipulation (e.g., Act, Bully, Inspire, Lie, Seduce), against a contested WIS-based ability check. Modifiers to the check are very dependent on the actions taken out by the active character and the degree of trust that the target has with the attacker. Quite often a gaslighter will engage in some actions of Mental bruises to weaken the victim's resistance before launching the gaslight attack. Nevertheless, it is *almost* impossible to make a target believe impossible things ("Are you going to believe me or your own eyes?"). The default modifier is -6, meaning that the attacker has to engage in significant preparation for the chance of a successful attack.

Each gaslighting attack takes a strategic turn. The difference in between the gaslighting attacker and the WIS resistance determines the effect. If the result favours the attacker, the victim receives 1 Mental wound per point of difference. If the the defender succeeds they can cure 1 Mental Wound per point of difference from previous damage caused by the attacker. If the defender has already cured all their Mental wounds or has not acquired to begin with, they will doubt the attacker and their motives, and may make an INT check with +1 per point of succeed and a target number of 11, to gain the realisation that they are under attack. Under these circumstances the target may decide to turn the tables and entrap and gaslight the attacker!

Gaslighting is easier if there is a group attacking, and harder if there is a group of defenders. For 2 attackers acting in concert the attack bonus is +1, if 4 the bonus is +2, and if 8 or more the bonus is +3. The same bonuses are apply for defenders. A fascinating situation can erupt when two parties are attempting to gaslight each other.

**Gossip**

Gossip is the spreading of rumours of unsavoury behaviour, words, or motives about a person or persons. Whilst the actual words are carried out in tactical time, it is actually a strategic action as it requires the rumours to be spread among multiple individuals and reinforced to be true. Three subjects can be recipients of a rumour per Strategic action. Gossip is carried out with the Lie skill if the subject of the rumour is not actually true, or Inspire (at +2 to the skill roll) if it is, and is carried out against a WIS-based ability check. Modifiers are dependent on the degree of trust that the active character has with their subjects. Each subject in a workplace who is convinced by the rumour-mongerer will cause 1 Social Bruise to the victim, who may not even be aware that they are under attack. Instead they may experience degrees of partial ostracism as a result (e.g., people fall silent in conversation when they arrive). The gossiper can attempt to amplify this result with multiple attacks; the second Bruise will require two strategic actions, the third will require four strategic actions, the fourth Bruise six strategic actions etc. 

If the recipients of the rumour succeecd in the contest of skills they will have sufficient doubt of ther veracity of the story. If they are friendly to the victim they will certainly inform them that they are under attack and of the source. Further they will gain a continuing bonus of +4 against any further attempts of the rumour-monger to spread information in the future. The victim and their allies may then attempt to remove the cause of the gossip with evidence, real or contrived, also requiring a Lie or Inspire skill check. However because gossip is easier to spread than to defend, it comes with a penalty of -2, and there is difficulty in locating those who have been subject to the rumour. Again three subjects can receive counter-gossip information per Strategic turn. A calculating victim probably realises that if they have sufficient Social hit points to begin with that perhaps the best counter to gossip is to start a new set of rumours against the source themselves. The chaos that this causes in the workplace is, of course, up to The Boss to explore fully.

**Invention**

**Legal Contest**

**Revelry**

> Graham: You guys are being attacked   
Monster: DO I SEE THAT HAPPENING?!?!  
Graham: No, you're outside by the Tavern   
Monster: COOL, I GET DRUNK   
Graham: Sigh... there are seven ogres surrounding you   
Galstaff: How could they surround us? I had Mordenkainen's Magical Watchdog cast   
Graham: No you didn't!   
Monster: I'M GETTING DRUNK, ARE THERE ANY GIRLS THERE?   
-- Dead Alewives *Summoner Geeks*, 1996

Revelry is the ability to engage in excess drink, partake in dangerous recreational pharmaceuticals, engage in sexual pleasures of wild abandon etc, with others in a manner that is pleasurable. It consists of two components, *carousing* and *stamina*, both governed by the skills of the same name. Usually such partying only lasts for only one to three strategic turns, depending on the activity in question and the relative success of the skill check. Target numbers depend on the relative degree that the environment is conducive to the activity, with modifiers according to the quality of technological assistance that might be available. 

Carousing skill checks in this context refers to ability of the character to be charismatic in the festive environment, and perhaps even gain some useful information, allies, or reputation whilst doing so, whereas a failed check represents poor behaviour, and suffering Social wounds (1d6 for a failure, 2d6 for a failure of 4 or more, 3d6 for a failure of 8 or more etc). Stamina skill checks, against the Athletics (Stamina) skill, will have similar results for Physical wounds. It is very possible for a character to succeed in Carousing and fail in their Stamina check, for example, acquiring quite a reputation for being a "party animal", and with poor recollection of what they actually go up to (c.f., "The Hangover" movie series).

The enticements of Revelrous activity can be strong; the base target number to resist such inducements is only 7 plus or minus WIS modifier, but can be modified by generosity ("I'm at a bar here now down in the Fourth Sector. Taffy Lewis's on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a drink?") and quality of the offer ("I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place."). A character who is already engaging in reverly will be more prone to engage in further revelry (-2 to resistance checks). 

One of the further issues of engaging in such behaviour is that a character is obviously unable to engage in whatever their current project is whilst engaging in revelry, and perhaps for some time afterwards whilst recovering. Thus whilst there is a tradition of PCs in other games to engage in such activity in non-critical situations as a bit of a joke, they sober up with the situation gets serious. To encourage PC Workers in *Papers & Paychecks* to be amusingly irresponsible, any character who volunarily engages in revelry when they should be working received a Player Point.


## 2.5 Damage and Healing

*Papers & Paychecks* uses a unified damage system. Damage is based on the weapon type and circumstances and is differentiated between deadly *wounds* and less dangerous *bruises*. All wounds also cause bruising damage, but bruises only cause a wound for every 5 points of bruising.

To work out the damage caused, calculate difference between attack roll and defense roll (e.g., 13 vs 10 = 3). This provides the the base damage. A multiplier is applied to this base damage depending on the equipment, skill, or position, and reductions to damage based on armour. 

For example physical attacks apply a multiplier depending on the weapon: Fists = 1/2x, clubs, knives = 1x, swords = 2x, handguns = 3x, rifles = 4x. Attack with surprise = +1x. Determine whether the damage is *wounds* or *bruises*. For physical weapons, 'bashing' weapons cause *bruises*, whereas impaling, stabbing, explosive, shredding, burning, eviscerating, and basically anything that gets under the skin, causes wounds.

Physical damage is applied against STR-based physical hit points. If a character reaches 0 physical bruises they are knocked unconscious. If they are reduced to zero wounds the character is is dead and out-of-game.

Mental damage applied against WIS-based mental hit points. If a character reaches 0 mental bruises they are in a state of mental shock and cannot react.  

Social wounds are applied against CHA-base social hit points; if a character is reduced to 0 social hit points they suffer a serious loss of reputation and are out-of-project. If they are reduced to negative social hit points they have suffered a "social death" and are out-of-game.

## 2.6 Equipment in Detail

In *Papers & Paychecks* equipment is purchased with cash, rather like a traditional "gold piece" RPG, and is assigned a weight which determines its resistance to be carried, lifted, or even thrown in some cases. Most equipment listed is explained in terms of direct capabilities - there is little need or room in this publication for equipment that is pure 'colour'. Finally, equipment may have a relative rarity or even legality. Where this is the case, it is explained in the text.

**Technological Development**

*Papers & Paychecks* is firmly set in the advanced industrial period, anywhere from around 1970 onwards. The game is designed to cover the development of a character from their first years in a job until retirement - around a fifty year period. Giving some leeway in the starting year of a *Papers and Paychecks* saga, the starting year should be anywhere from 1980 to 2000 and retirement from 2030 to 2050. This is, as we know, a a period of significant technological change and as a result the equipment examples also must accurately represent those changes.

Where appropriate various items of equipment are provided with reference to their time of general introduction to the consumer market and future developments from that point. Some of this is inevitably speculative, as if even this designer cannot predict the future with the required level of accuracy. Where the description of equipment in the game conflicts with reality, reality wins and The Boss should modify appropriately. The game avoids abstract methods of technological developments in favour of concrete examples.

**Contraband**

Goodness knows why, but Player-Characters often think its a good idea to try to get hold of contraband. Indeed, some malicious Bosses even make it seem like it's a requirement for completion of a scenario. Fortunately most goods and services are legal, albeit with various degrees of commercial regulation. When purchasing goods that have a degree of restriction, consult the table below. The three categories of contraband are Professional, that is, they assume a particular license in a particular profession (e.g., medical) to have available, Military, that is, the good or service is of military-grade restriction, and Illegal, that is the good or service is illegal under almost all circumstances in the society in question. The Difficulty Rating is the target number (with Knowledge:Streetwise or similar) that is required to obtain the good, and the time is the number of Strategic Turns required. The price is a multiplier on what the cost would be if the good was not contraband.

| Restriction	| Difficulty Rating	| Time	| Price |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------|-------|
| Professional  | 11			| 2	|  2    |
| Military	| 15			| 4	|  4	|
| Illegal	| 19			| 8	|  8    |

**Standards of Living**

One matter which is screened out of the game is general household costs, utilities, groceries, and so forth. The management of mortgages and rents, whilst so important in the real world, are largely abstracted in this game in terms of a general 'household standard' expense with categories that correlate with the 'rolled wealth' score from character generation. Note that real wages for middle and low-income workers has not changed sufficiently since the 1970s to make any difference to standards of living. As an example of some rather grim humour where dreams of the future are shattered, and as an endorsement of the cyberpunk ethic, real wages and purchasing power will not change throughout the entire period of the game until 2050 and perhaps beyond.
 
| Rolled Wealth	Equivalent | Weekly Cost	|	Household Standard									|
|---------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2		| $200	| Very poor. Dilapidated rented housing, utilities often out-of-order or cut off, shortage of basic necessities, poor quality tinned food and cheap staples | 
| 3-5		| $300	| Poor. Lower class rented house or apartment, low level of utilities, necessities met, simple and sometimes fresh foodstuffs |
| 6-8		| $500	| Average. Surburan mortgaged house or large apartment, good supply of utilities, surplus of necessities, and foodstuffs |
| 9-11		| $800	| Above average. Large mortgaged suburban house or large townhouse, excess of modern utilities, never short of necessities, high quality food, drinks, and excellent meals etc | 
| 12		| $1300	| Very rich. Very large owned multistory suburban house or large inner-city townhouse, latest in utilities, the best quality in foods, drinks, and exceptional meals  |

**Armour**

*Leather Jacket*: For the fashion conscious there is no going past the traditional leather jacket, with comes with a varying cost, Encumbrance, defense value, and Carousing value which has fascinatingly inverted values. A *stylish* jacket will have a cost of $400, a +1 bonus to Carousing, a ENC value of 1. A *protective* jacket will cost $200, has an ENC value of 2, and will reduce damage by 2 points. A jacket that is *stylish* and *protetcive* costs $600, provides a +1 to Carousing, reduces damage by 2 points, and has an ENC value of 2. A faux leather jacket costs $100, and has an ENC value of 1. If a perception check by other characters (target number 11) is *failed* it will provide a +1 Carousing bonus. If they succeed, it will have a -1 penalty - these values are reversed when the other members of the social circle are animal liberationists of various stripes.

*Fire Proximity Suit and Hazmat*: Occassionally a PC Worker may find themselves in need of specialist clothing for full-body protection such as a Fire Proximity Suit or Hazmat Suit, although it would be a particularly cruel Boss that makes such items required for a scenario (i.e., ensure that this happens at least a few times). There are several types of Hazmat suit of which the FPS is the most common. All have an ENC value of 3, which provides full body protection. A FPS will protect from 5-15 points of fire hand heat damage with a price of $500 to $1500, proportional on the degree of proetction. Hazmat suits protect against chemical, nuclear, or biological agents and will include respirators. Typical cost is $300 for simple coveralls against most chemical protection (no damage reduction, only 2 ENC) up to $2000 for a fully enclosed NBC suit with internal oxygen supply which provides 5 points of physical armour protection and 5 points of fire damage reduction.

*Bullet Proof Armour* There is various forms of armour designed against bullets. It is rare, but not unknown, for characters in *Papers & Paychecks* to require these. These come in values of 1, 2, or 3 ENC and each level protects for 2, 4, or 8 points of armour or double that (4, 8, or 16 points) if protecting against firearms. A bullet will still hurt (a lot) but the character will *probably* not be dead. This body armour costs $200, $400, or $800, respectively and the third level is only available after 1985. A fourth level of body armour, made from spider-goats is available from 2030 onwards. It has an ENC of 2 and protects for 16 points against all forms of attack. It costs $1200. 

**Clothing**

A character's Standard of Living provides appropriate clothes to their standard for home life, and acceptable clothes for the workplace. There are however, special clothes which provide bonues to various skills. These include:

*Actor's Wardrobe*: To the untrained eye, an actor's wardrobe is just a hodge-podge of various garments that look like they have come from an opportunity shop. In reality this is a carefully selected range which allows for bonuses to the Act skill through disguise. The wardrobe consist of a collection of a dozen outfits with an ENC of 1 each and makeup, for a bonus of +1 to Acting and a cost of $200. A larger wardrobe and makeup kit will cost $300 for a bonus of +2.

*Party Outfit*: A fashionable set of clothes that is an absolute knockout at social gatherings regardless of social setting. Each outfit weights 1 ENC. An outfit that provides +1 to Carousing will cost $100, one that provides +2 to Carousing will cost $200, and one that provides +3 to Carousing will cost $400. A provocative version provides the same bonus and same cost for the Seduction skill. 

*Workplace Outfit*: Favoured among managers and those who wish to protect themselves from managers, this power suit can be used to either Bully or Lie. All power suits weights 1 ENC. A suit that adds +1 to either Bully or Inspire, as desired by the character, will cost $200. If the suit provides a +2 bonus to either of the skills, it will cost $400, and if it provides +3, the suit will cost $800.

*Orator's Attire*: Unlike the power suit, the Orator's Attire is more designed to be inviting and put people at ease. Each suit weights 1 ENC. An outfit that provides +1 to Inspire will cost $200, one that provides +2 to will cost $300, and one that provides +3 will cost $400.

**Communications and Electronics Equipment**

Communications and electronic equipment is various much dependent on technological developments. Over time many of their functions merge into single hand-held devices.

*Camera*: A camera captures still or moving images on either photographic film or electronic sensor. Early cameras use photographic film, whereas more modern versions use digital medium, which has an advantage of improved storage medium. All cameras use the Craft (Visual Art) skill for the production of the art, and Craft (mechanical) or Craft (electronic) for construction, modification, and repairs. Cameras can be generally described as cheap, average, or expensive. Cheap cameras are easy to use (+2 to Visual Art skill), but are capped with a maximum result of 14. Average cameras have no modification to use, but are capped in with a maximum result of 18. Expensive cameras are difficult to use (-2 to Visual Art skill), but have no maximum result cap. All still cameras have a ENC of 1, and cost $100 (cheap), $200 (average), or $400 (expensive). Video cameras have an ENC of 2, and cost $300, $600, and $1200 respectively.

*Mobile Phone, 1980*: From the 1980s to around 1995 mobile phones were oversized, expensive, and with very limited battery life. They have an ENC of 2, and cost $5000, and have approximately an one hour talk time (and a ten hour recharge). They were most common in Scandinavia and Japan.

*Mobile Phone, 1990*: In the 1990s the adoption of the 2G GSM network, improved battery technology, and better components reduces the ENC of a mobile phone to 1, the cost to $1000, and increases the talk time to three hours with a five hour recharge.

*Mobile Phone, 2000*: In the 2000s, using a 3G network, mobile phones are increasingly feature-rich with limited Internet access. By this stage they have an effective ENC of 0, the cost is down to $500, talk time is increased to five hours with a five hour recharge. 

*Mobile Phone, 2010*: In the 2010s, using the 4G WiMAX standard, mobile phones have fully integrated Internet access. Mobile phones of this era also incorporate a cheap camera and radio as standard. ENC of 0, cost $500, talk time is increased to fifteen hours with a two hour recharge.

*Mobile Phone, 2020*: In the 2020s, using the 5G standard, mobile phones have fully integrated Internet access, an expensive camera, radio, and all the computational capacity of a 2010 desktop computer. ENC of 0, cost $500, talk time is increased to twenty-five hours with a one hour recharge.

*Mobile Phone, 2030*: In the 2020s, using the 6G WiMAX standard, mobile phones have fully integrated Internet access, expensive camera, radio, and the all the computation capacity of a 2020 desktop computer. ENC of 0, cost $500, talk time is increased to fifty hours with a one hour recharge.

*Radio*: A 1970s-2000s portable radio allows for reception of broadcast signals either on various broadcasting transmissions (AM, FM, Shortwave). They have an ENC of 0-2, and cost from $10 to $500 depending on the quality of the system. More expensive systems are have a greater sensitivity to broadcasts, and a longer lifespan. After the 2000s radios are almost universally incorporated into mobile phones.

*Walkie-Talkie*: Also known as a handheld radio transceiver, this is effectively an inexpensive, limited range, mobile phone. Typical range is around 50km, with a variety of channels of frequency transmission and reception. Effective ENC is 0, cost is $100 for a pair. 

**Computer Equipment**

> The Computer is happy. The Computer is crazy. The Computer will help you become happy. This will drive you crazy.
> *Paranoia*, 1984

For the office environment of *Papers & Paychecks* nothing is more ubiquitous in presence and in technological development than the computer. Several desktop models are presented here a five-year scale in systems is provided, during which there is rapid depreciation after introduction - after five years the system can be considered close to worthless. The details are abstracted of course, and there will be numerous variations from the standards provided in terms of capabiliy and cost. 

Portable systems (laptops, tablets) are available from 1990 onwards. They cost twice as much as a desktop system with half the performance (in terms of RAM, hard disk, and processor speed), and ENC. Portable systems do not have printer peripherals and use an LCD screen.

For mainframe systems (1980 to 1995) assume specifications 5 years ahead of the desktop (i.e., 1980 mainframe will use a 1985 desktop specifications), and will cost ten times as much and 50 ENC. For a cluster computer system (1995 onwards), simply multiply the number of desktop systems that make up the cluster, add extra systems to represents login or management nodes, and double the cost to represent high-speed interconnect (about double the standard), and external storage arrays. For cloud systems (2005 onwards), simply assume multiple virtual systems are available with a small overhead.

Operating computer systems is either by the command line, GUI (graphic user interface), or voice activation. Each of these has a variation in difficulty noted in the text (which also represents operating system development), and speed. Voice activation is the slowest and easiest, requiring twice as long as GUI usage, which in turn takes twice as long as the command line interface. Real hackers use the command line. 

See the section for Computing under 2.3 Tactical Task Resolution, and the Intelligence-based skill, Craft (Computing) under 1.6 Skills and Knowledges for use.

*1980 Desktop*. CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) screen, a dot matrix or daisywheel printer, 64KB of RAM, tape or disk drive, 8 bit procesor of 2-3 MHz. Network via acoustic coupler or 300 baud modem. Computer operations are based on a command-line interface -2 to skill roll, 5 ENC, $2000.

**Firearms**

Many roleplaying games in a modern or futuristic setting provide a very long list of firearms, with specific models, bullet sizes, rate-of-fire, range, damage decrements with range, recoil, snap-shot numbers etc. This might be appropriate for a game that is centered on gun combat, and it often extraordinary to see such lists when the game is *not* centered on such activities. *Papers & Paychecks* is *not* a game centered on gun combat. It does happen *sometimes* and because it represents a mortal threat to the characters it is important, but the list significantly reduced in detail and quanity. With this in mind, the following firearms are offered: crossbow, handgun, submachine gun, assault rifle, and sniper rifle. 

Due to various technological improvements and targeting systems, each firearm receives a +1 bonus to skill use every ten years i.e., +0 to the firearms skill at 1975, +1 at 1985, +2 at 1995, +3 at 2005, +4 at 2015, +5 at 2025, +6 at 2035, to a truly frightening +7 at 2045. If a firearm is denoted as semi-automatic, it can fire three bullets per action at -1 to the skill roll. If the firearm is capable of burst fire, it can fire five rounds, at -2 to hit for five rounds, per action. In addition, in burst fire mode a firearm can conduct a spray attack against multiple targets, at -2 per additional target, and with 1 round lost per 5m separation between the targets.

Resolution of the use of firearms is covered in section 1.6 Skills and Knowledges under 'Firearms', and 2.3 Tactical Task Resolution under 'Physical Conflict'. Characters receive a bonus of +2 up to their PER skill in meters, and -2 from the listed range to double that value as long range, and -4 to three times the listed range for extreme range.

*Crossbow*: Less of a combat weapon and more of a hobby, the crossbow is a late medieval weapon that is still available as an exotic device. Relatively silent compared to guns. Requires a reloading action after each round. $200, 2 ENC, 1x damage, range 50m.

*Handgun*: A standard side-arm for law enforcement officers, sporting enthusiasts, and criminals alike with a medium range. Can fire single-shot, or semi-automatic per action. Requires a reloading action every 10 rounds. $100, 1 ENC, 3x damage, range 50m. 

*Submachine Gun*: A short-barrelled machine gun with limited range but a rapid rate of fire. Can fire single-shot, semi-automatic, or burst. Requires a reloading action after 20 rounds. $300, 2 ENC, 3x damage, range 50m.

*Assault Rifle*: A long-barrelled rifle with medium range and a rapid rate of fire. Can fire single-shot, semi-automatic, or burst each action. Requires a reloading action after 30 rounds. $400, 3 ENC, 4x damage, range 100m.

*Rifle*. A long-barrelled rifle with long range and a low rate of fire. Can fire single-shot. Requires a reloading action after 10 rounds. $500, 3 ENC, 4x damage, range 250m.

**Melee Weapons**

The comments made on firearms, above, also apply for melee weapons. *Papers & Paychecks* is not a combat-heavy game, at least not in most cases. Nevertheless there are a few situations where weapons of various might be used. 

*Improvised*: Improvised crushing weapons include a half-brick, a thrown rock (using melee skill, up to STR metres in base range), a sturdy chunk of wood, a chair, or similar. Because they are not designed to be used in combat melee attacks with such weapons are at -2. A one-handed improvised weapon has an ENC of 1 and causes 1x damage. A two-handed improvised weapon has an ENC of 2 and causes 2x damage.

> Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee: That's not a knife. That's a knife.`
> Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, 1986

*Knife*: A small knife has an effective ENC of 0, and does 1x damage in wounds and can be thrown up to STR metres in base range. A large knife is the sort used for gutting fish, hacking away through very big steaks and the like. It has an ENC of 1 and does 2x damage in wounds. 

*Club*: Often found in the form of sporting equipment, like a cricket or baseball bat, this one or two-handed weapon has an ENC of 2, and does 1x damage (one-handed) or 2x damage (two-handed) in bruises.

*Axe*: In the one-handed hatched variety which can be used as a melee weapon and which can also be thrown up to STR meters in range, an axe has an ENC of 1 and does 2x damage. As a two-handed weapon it has a modifier of -1 to use, due to being unbalanced, an ENC of 2, and does 3x damage in wounds.

*Sword*: Possibly the rarest of weapons encountered in *Papers & Paychecks* it is plausible that a character may encounter a fencing sword, or, if they are at a museum or expensive hotel, an arming sword. A fencing sword is particularly well balanced weapon and is +2 to the melee skill to use, has an ENC of 1, and causes 2x damage. An arming sword has a +1 bonus to use, an ENC of 2, and causes 3x damage in wounds.

**Outdoor Equipment**

Sometimes characters have to go outside into "The Big Room". You know, the room that connects all the other rooms together, the one with the bright yellow light and blue or grey ceiling during work hours and with the ambient lights during sleeping time. There are rare and curious situations when workers are scurried away to holiday camps in rural areas for a "corporate retreat" or a similar team-building exercise. The following items of equipment are the small selection for such adventures.

*Camping Basics*: Rather than listing each item individually, this is a backpack of outdoor survival equipment which a sensible person would take with them (test with WIS + Survival with a +4 bonus to remember). It includes a compass, a cooking stove and pot, knife and fork, firestarters, local maps, powerful torch, hand shovel, and a roll of toilet paper. $100, ENC 3

*First Aid Kit*: Also found in sensible workplaces, a first aid kt consists of an instruction booklet, supply of band-aids, gause dressings, eye dressings, various bandages, sterile gloves, tweezers, cleansing wipes, antiseptic spray or cream, mild painkillers, distilled water, emergency rescue blanket, instant ice-pack, scissors, etc). $100, ENC 2

*Sleeping Bag and Bedroll*: Insulated bedding equipment with zippers for retaining heat, water repellent exterior, and sleeping mat. Price depends on quality. Protection from the elements has improved over time, +1 to Survival rolls from 1975-1995, +2 from 1996-2020, +3 from 2021 onwards. $50-$150 ENC 2

*Two-Person Tent*: The modern camping tent consist of a lightweight waterproof fabric, frame, and tarpaulin. As with sleeping bags, price depends on quality, and provides bonuses like bonus Survival rolls according to time (i.e., +1 from 1975-1995, +2 from 1996-2020, +3 from 2021 onwards) due to material and construction improvements. $200-$800, ENC 3.

**Professional Equipment**

For whatever Professional skill a character has taken there is a set of tools, equipment, or even animals appropriate to the profession which provide a skill bonus. Expressed as a generic value, a $1000 item of hobby equipment provides a +1 bonus to a hobby skill check, a $2000 item of hobby equipment provides a +2 bonus, and a $4000 item of hobby equipment provides a +3 bonus. Hobby equipment has an ENC of 2.

**Vehicles**

*Bicycle*: A two-wheeled, human-pedal-powered, vehicle which includes pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels. Whilst specialist versions exist for particular environments (racer, road bike, hybrid, mountain bike), which can be elaborated at the Boss's desire, the statistics here assume a hybrid bike. The *ride* skill is used for using a bike, but they're mostly fairly easy to operate. Technological and material developments mean that bicycles have +1 ENC and -2 Move from 1975-1995, +0 ENC and +0 Move from 1996-2020, and -1 ENC and +2 Move from 2021 onwards. The Movement rate for a bicycle is twice the character's STR. Bicycles have enormous variation in cost and quality, ranging from $100 to $3000, with an ENC of 10.

*Economy Car*: A variety of small, cars, including the two-door microcars, hatchbacks, and city-cars. Can fit two people with some comfort and four with somewhat less. Includes a small luggage area. Prior to 1985 an economy car will manage 8km/litre of fuel, from 1985 to 2005 it will manage 12km/litre, from 2006 to 2025 it will do 16km/litre, and after that electric cars will be in use. The maximum speed of an economy car is 150kmph (c40m per second), will weigh 750kg, and has a fuel tank capacity of 50 litres. Cost $5000-$15000

*Sedan*: The standard mid-sized car, known as a Saloon in the United Kingdom, and also including station-wagons in this context. Easily fits four people and with extensive luggage area. Prior to 1985 an sedan will manage 6km/litre of fuel, from 1985 to 2005 it will manage 9km/litre, from 2006 to 2025 it will do 12km/litre, and after that electric cars will be in use. The maximum speed of an sedan is 200kmph (c55m per second), will weigh 1200kg, and has a fuel tank capacity of 75 litres. Cost $7500-$25000

*Luxury Car*: A mid-sized car, but designed for comfort, additional functionality, and quality in design. Statistics are generally as of the standard sedan, but with everything smoother, quieter, and more luxurious. Cost $55000-$250000 and upwards.

*Sports Car*: A streamlined, low-profile, two-person vehicle designed for speed and maneuverability. Minimal luggaage area.

Comes with a significant luggage area. Prior to 1985 an off-road car will manage 6km/litre of fuel, from 1985 to 2005 it will manage 9m/litre, from 2006 to 2025 it will do 12km/litre, and after that electric cars will be in use. The maximum speed of an off-road car is 150kmph (c40m per second), will weigh 1200kg, and has a fuel tank capacity of 75 litres. Cost $7500-$25000 and upwards.

## 2.7 Special Equipment

Normal equipment gives expected functionality and benefits, often with game system abstractions that match normal expectations of the equipment in question. "Special equipment" provides benefits that outside of this range. As a result they are incredible rare and expensive and should be treated like exotic 'magic items'. Why is this so? Because they *are* actually characters, like the "Monsters" in section 3.8, sapient spirits entrapped in prosaic items, although they are quite powerful in comparison and unlike the 'monsters', they are not directly malicious towards humans but rather are exasperated by their their moral failings and will frustrate such plans.

As a result, special equipment has intellectual characteristics and psychological dispositions, and will telepathically whisper suggestions in the minds of their holders acting like their conscience. They also have critical triggers when characters ignore these warnings, at which point they will seek to take control of the trangressor using psychic combat and possess the character. They surprisingly respect character integrity however, and this is short-term and will release their control once the dangerous period is over. 

**Armani Suit of Integrity**

INT 18 (+4), WIS 22 (+6), CHA 26 (+8), E+3 N+2 F+4 P+2 (Champion)

At first sight this appears to be a rather scintillating version of Orator's Attire (2.6, clothing), indeed, it does provide a +3 to Inspire. In addition however it provides an automatical Intellect Fortress (1.7, perks) without the spoken invocation simply by being in the presence of one so attired. It also provides +2 CHA to the wearer. However, the Suit of Integrity is also determined that the wearer lives up to their inspiring charisma as will make suggestions of honesty to the wearer. It will attempt a psychological attack against the wearer if they lie outright, and will darken when the character attempt to weasel their way out of a situation by being not-quite-honest. ENC 1, costs $4000

> Miranda: Ummm that was incredible. Was it good for you?   
Fletcher: I've had better.   
*Liar, Liar* (1997)

**Charles Atlas Manual of Bodily Strength, Annotated**

"The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac"! A manual that will train, from one strategic turn a day, into a Strength bonus. Every 10 days that a character makes use of the manual they will gain +1 STR, up to a maximum of +4. The Manual of Bodily Strength has an ENC of 1 and costs $4000.

**Knuth's The Art of Computing Programming, Annotated**

> *On two occasions, I have been asked [by members of Parliament], "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right 
answers come out?"...I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.*  
> Charles Babbage, *Passages from the life of a philosopher*, 1864

These four famous volumes contain many aspects of programming algorithms and analysis of their levels of efficiency. Each volumee will take five strategic turns to read, and a successful INT test with a target number of 15. If the check is failed, the character may check again at 13, 11, and to a minimum of 9. On the completion of all four volumes, the character gains an additional level in Tradesperson (technical) or Scientist, as desired. When the books are present, a character engaging in any strategic Craft (Computing) or Knowledge (Science - Computing) test the character receives a +2 bonus. Each volume has an ENC of 1 costs $250 each. 

**Potion of Socialability**

> *I drink when I have occasion, and sometimes when I have no occasion.*
> Miguel de Cervantes, *Don Quixote de la Mancha* (1605–1615) Part II (1615), Book III, Ch. 33.

The capacity of alcoholic drinks to provide sociability is well known and presented within this game. However, a potion of socialability is a very special version of said drinks. As normal, a standard dose is either one medium glass of beer, a small glass of wine, or a shot of spirit. Each standard dose of a Potion of Socialability increases the CHA of *others* interacting with the character by 1. You want to be their friend. Follow the rules for drinking under section 2.2.

**Ring of The Significant Other**

> *Marriage, n. A community consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all, two.*    
Ambrose Bierce, *The Devil's Dictionary*, 1967.

Ring 1: E+2 S+5 F+4 J+2	(Provider)
Ring 2: I+2 S+5 F+4 J+2 (Protector)

This pair of rings are exchanged between significant others in the public ritual of marriage. In the establishment of this relationship certain contractual obligations are entered into depending on the jurisdiction. In most cases the wearing of a marriage ring will receive a +2 bonus against Seduction attempts made against them. However, a Ring of Significant Other is *also* sapient paired device where the two devices are in a quantum entangled communication with each other. A Ring of Significant Other will be able to provide warnings to one wearer of the state of the other wearer, providing a sort of limited telepathy between the two wearers that is at the will of the two rings whose personality (provider and protector) they will seek to encourage. A Ring of Significant Other will also prevent the wearer via psychic attack from causing harm to the other wearer, including (and especially) acts of unapproved infidelity, and issue a warning via the second ring. A ring of Significant Other costs $10000+ each.

## 3.7 Bestiary

It is, of course, reasonably rare for animals to feature significantly in a game of *Papers & Paychecks* but there are rare and comical exceptions. The choice of animals to include in a bestiary are, of course, quite challenging. There is relative levels of rarity, diversity of size and species, and so forth. Ultimately choice comes down to what is most appropriate for the setting, whether as pets, farm animals, or wildlife. From this collection and a few interesting variations a Boss may hopefully derive additional alternatives.

As with other aspects of the game, the bestiary combines realistic information, playable and abtracted game system statistics, and hints for incorporating the creature into the game as a capsule scenario description. The statistical values assigned to the creatures are for adult members of the species and may vary by up to 50% for each characteristic, unless otherwise specified. Bonuses to various skills under the 'other' category are a result of specific physical attributes. 

The following creatures are provided for *Papers & Paychecks*: Blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), Brown Rat Rattus norvegicus), Cat (Felis catus), Cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), Common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), Dog (Canis familiaris), Goat (Capra aegagrus hircus), Horse (Equus ferus caballus), Sheep (Ovis aries), Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).

**Blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna)**

The blue-and-yellow macaw is a South American parrot with a blue dorsal region and yellow (or gold) ventral region. Whilst in the wild it typically lives in forest and woodlands, it is very common as a companion animal, partially due to their vivid colours and partially due to the ability to mimic sounds and speech. 

Physically, the are are usually around 75cm to 85cm long and weight between 1.0 and 1.5 kilogrammes. In breeding they have the same mates for life, nesting almost exclusively on palms. The most colourful male will be the most successful in attracting a mate. The female lays on average 2-3 eggs which are incubated for 28 days. After hatching, the most dominant chick will receive most of the food, with the others dying. A chick reaches fledgling stage after approximately 97 days. A macaw will typically live 30 to 35 years.

As a large bird the macaw requires significant space in capativity - 15m at least is recommended. They are especially vocal when seeking attention, and their powerful beak serves not only as an aid in climbing, but also in the destruction of chewable items. Their diet is a variety of fruits and nuts and other foilage, and will forage for an area of up to 100km in the wild.

*A Macaw story*

A manager reads an article that having animals in an workplace is a good idea for increasing morale and productivity. Unfortunately they didn't read enough of the article and decides what is best for the office as a 'bring your pet to work' day. With a variety of cats, dogs, birds, and even a goldfish or two, the day's work is a complete write-off as mayhem results. In the course of events, a macaw belonging to Chris, a computer programmer in the company, lands on a PC's should and whispers in a sultry voice in his ear, "I love you Gary".

The voice is unmistakable; it belongs to NPC administrator Suzy, with whom Chris has been in a relationship with for several months. Do the PCs confront Suzy, inform Chris, or try to get more information out of the parrot? If they attempt the latter not only will the parrot's mimicry become more "adult" in flavour, it will also start revealing some other startling secrets of both Chris and Suzy.

Based on a story that was, alas, not quite true.

**Brown Rat (Rattus norvegicus)**

Typically grey or brown in colour, with domesticated variants including white and other natural shades, the brown rat has a body of up to 25cm long and weighing from 250 to 500 grammes. They have terrible vision (around 20/600) although they can see some ultraviolet light, but good hearing and a very well developed sense of smell. Wherever humans live, the brown rat will also be found, making them a highly successful species, albeit one that is associated with damaging to local ecosystems, destroying crops, and as a disease vector. Selective breeding sees the species as laboratory rats and fancy rats. These animals have notably different psychological profiles to their wild varieties.

As a true omnivore and will eat almost anything, with cereals constituting the major part of the brown rat diet. Breeding is best described as 'opportunistic promiscuity', with females producing up to five litters a year with a gestation period of around 21 days and litters of around seven. Sexual maturity is reached in a mere five weeks. The average lifespan of a brown rat is only a year, primarily due to predattion in the wild. A domestic brown rat can reach an age of three years.

Famous for their intelligence, the rat is a social animal which communicates with high-pitched squeaks, body language (e.g., ear twitching), and urine markings. Rats are capable of forward planning, have shown surprisingly high levels of empathy towards other members of their species (even those whom they have not previously encountered), have complex dreams, and show signs of remorse when they've made the wrong choice.

*A rat story*

The PC Workers are working in a medical research centre, large hospital, or similar. Disasters do happen, both natural and human made, and in this situation a building has collapsed trapping several individuals underneath the rubble. Whilst emergency services are on their way, a disheveled medical manager barges into the PC Workers' workplace pleading for assistance. One of the people deeply buried in the rubble was a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare disease which is treated with eculizumab (trade name 'Soliris'). This is the most expensive drug in the world, and the individual in question was in a room which contained five year's worth of the drug - which costs some several hundred thousands of dollars per year. An insightful PC Worker will note that the reaction of the medical manager is that they are more concerned with the drug rather than the patient, who is presumably wealthy enough to afford the drug.

The PC Workers are well aware of this medical condition and the expense of the drug as one of them at least is involved in a labratory rat training programme where, like the HeroRats of Mozambique, they have been trained to sniff out the blood samples of people to determine whether they suffer from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. They have several rats with varying levels of training which could be used to locate their patient - and presumably the supplies - deep under the rubble.

**Cat (Felis catus)**

The domestic cat has been kept by humans for companionship and to hunt vermin for thousands of years, having been orginally domesticated in ancient Egypt where they were venerated. They are the most popular mammal companion in a human household by number with an estimated worldwide population of 600 million. As a result, cats will be found pretty much wherever humans are found. Approximately a third of human households will have at least one cat. Whilst domestication has resulted in minimal behavioural changes (which has led to a significant problem of predation on wildlife species), it has significantly affected some biological factors, such a lifespan; the average lifespan of a cat has increased from 7 years in the 1980s, rising to to 9.5 in the mid-1990s, to 12-15 in the 2010s.

Whilst subject to a variety of breeds and subbreeds, some general comments can be made. A carnvirous species, they typically weigh between 3-6 kg. Despite the small size, they have a relatively powerful jaw, dense musculture, and large eye sockets. Cats have excellent night vision, ultrasound, and smell, but a poor sense of colour vision and a very poor sense of taste. Th They are famous for their agility with direct registration of their hind and front paws when walking. Due to their evolutionary heritage cats are capable of tolerating high temperatures, with discomfort only evident when skin temperature reaches 52 deg. C., (humans experience discomfort at 38 deg). Cat's are notorious slackers at will sleep on average 12-16 hours a day.

Domestic cats are, contrary to popular belief, somewhat sociable (with the exception when hunting), albeit with defined and sometimes disputed territories, and neutral zones, all marked by urine spraying. A colony of cats usually ends up with a dominant sexually male whose territory will be the largest and can overlap several female cat territories. Breeding season typically begins in autumn and ends in late spring, with a gestation period from 64 to 67 days and litter of 3-5 kittens, possibly from multiple fathers. Independence is reached in 3 months and sexual maturity is reached in 5-10 months. 

Domestic cat communication includes purring, hisses, growling, meowing, and a variety of body language cues such as the position and direction of ears and tail, raising of fur to indicate aggression etc. In addition, cats enjoy playing, mimicking hunting and fighting. Cats are known to have complex dreams. Whilst capable of learning through operant conditioning, they have a poor sense of causality.

*A Cat Story*

Maneki-neko ("beckoning cat"), is figurine of a Japanese calico bobtail, traditionally believed by retailers of bringing in customers, and thus acting as an anti-austerity measure. In this episode an otherwise serious and conservative Japanese buisnessman has one affection and superstition - a pet bobtail. A competiting firm has hired a thief to steal the cat just prior to a major client contract being signed, with the hope that the loss of the cat will cause their negotiating skills to fail. The PC Workers are directed to find the cat as the local police are obviously too busy to search for a cat. A succession of clues will lead towards their thief, but as time goes on the businessman's behaviour will show signs stress as he becomes more desperate in the search for his cat, juxtaposing with his normally unflappable exterior.

**Cattle (Bos primigenius taurus) and Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)**

> *Cows with Guns*, Dana Lyons, 1996

Members of the *bovinae* subfamily, cattle and water buffalo are sufficiently close to be considered at the same time. These are large quadrupedal ungulate mammals with cloven hooves, and typically horned. Weighing from 300 kg (water buffalo, female) to 1,250kg (cattle, male), and with a lifespan of around 18-22 years, cattle and water buffalo are mainly known for their domestication from a human perspective, as a beast of burden, or as a source of food. Indeed, most people have significantly more interaction with a steak than they do with a cow.

The various bovine species are herd animals with collective behaviour. The typical herd has bulls taking the circumference of the herd's range protecting the cows and calves. The gestation period for a cow is about nine months long. Adult size is highly variable by sex, species, and breed. Typical lifespan is around 20-25 years.

A bovine is less able to apply it's full Strength to melee, intimidation etc. As a result the effective Strength is halved. For purposes of carrying capacity and weight however, the full strength is applied, as it will be if a character is trampled. Bovines have no fine manipulation - their effective Dexterity for such things is quartered.

*A Bovine story*

The player characters turn up to work one day and there's a cow in the office. It will certainly make a mess, and there is a good chance that it will wreck havoc if people try to move it. It will take a bit of an investigation but eventually it will turn out to achieved ingress through a near-forgotten goods lift. A review of company security records indicates that a person with a misplaced (but not deactivated) visitors security pass is responsible for bringing the c0w in the office. 

Eventually the player characters may discover that there is a local diary competition at some nearby showgrounds. It will turn out that a disgruntled fomer employee, who had been sacked for absenteeism and a drinking issue, had stolen the cow from the showgrounds and brought it into the office. In an unexpected twist the owner of the cow will not press any charges, and indeed will offer the former employee a job in the country. After all, anyone who can steal a cow whilst drunk in the middle of the night, transport it half way across the city, and sneak it into an office building, must have some skills in herding.

**Common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)**

The closest genetic relatives to humans, chimpanzees are two species of the great apes in the genus Pan, which includes the common chimpanzee (*pan troglodytes*, described here) and the bonobo (*pan paniscus*). Whilst they are native to sub-Saharan Africa, and specifically the Congo jungle (common chimps to the north of the Congo River, bonobo to the south), characters in *Papers & Paychecks* are most likely to encounter them in zoos or, ridiculously, as pets. 

Chimpanzees are not tall creatures and have notable sexual dimorphism; The male common chimp stands up to 1.2 m and weighs about 40 to 60 kilograms, whereas a female is approximately 1m high at weighs between 30 to 50 kg. Despite this height, they are surprisingly strong with significant skeletal muscle fibres and with long powerful arms (indeed, longer than their legs). The hair is either dark brown or black. They are semi-bipedal, working mainly on their knuckles. Chimpanzee diet is heavily based on fruit, but they are omnivorous, and will eat other foilage, honey, insects, and other chimps or monkeys. Their lifespan is approximately 35 years.

Chimpanzees have a complex social organisation which varies between the species. Among *pan troglodytes* an alpha male with a carefully negotiated alliance of supporters, dominates a troop. Among *pan paniscus* there is a greater level of egalitarianism. The species differ in their levels of violence as well; *pan troglodytes* has a more violent culture, whereas *pan paniscus* are highly sexual. Both species have polyandrous mating behaviour. They are quite intelligent and will engage in sophisticated tactics, and are known to use tools - digging sticks and even spears - whilst hunting, or for building nests.

The reduction in the chimps intimidation and the increase in their stealth skills is due to the relative difference between their relatively small size and significant strength. A second successful physical attack from a chimpanzee will do double damage, indicating a bite with its large and sharp canines.

*A Chimpanzee story*

A Human Resources manager, who lives in a nearby inner city apartment, has a pet chimp named King Kong. A terrible workaholic the manager is known to their work home with them. What is less well known is that they're on a prescription of strong anti-anxiety drugs. The inevitable has happened and the chimp has gobbled down a handful drugs and is now undergoing a psychotic episode. The HR manager has arrived at work, understandably flustered, and appoints the PC Workers to recover their work laptop, which is now in the chimp's possession. The laptop in question has all employee, tax, and pay records and the HR manager isn't savvy enough to understand the difference between local and network drives. If the PC Workers raise an objection to undertaking the task, they will be pointed to a clause in their job description contract will requires them to undertake "Other duties as required".

Arriving at the apartment tower, the chimp has attracted quite a crowd. It has thrown all the furniture  out of the apartment on to the streets below. This includes a sofa, a bed, and even a fridge, just to give a sense of its strength. It is now standing on the balcony with the laptop tucked under its arm making quite a racket. Attempts to take on the chimp directly on the balcony will see a character converted to street pizza. Observant characters will notice that on street level there is a store that sells drones. Piloting these towards the chimp will cause it to climb higher up the apartment block, re-enacting the famous final scene of its namesake.

**Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)**

The common chicken is a subspecies of the Red junglefowl (*Gallus gallus*) that was domesticated some five thousand years ago in Asia. There are several subspecies of the wild variety as well, including domesticated chickens that have returned to a wild state. By far the most common domestic fowl in the world, numbering some 19 billion in 2011, in *Papers & Paychecks* the most common encounter of characters with a chicken is on a dinner plate. Many people consume chicken periods for breakfast (whilst others prefer bee vomit on toast). For their own part, chickens are omnivores and even cannibalistic.

Assuming avoidance of the knife, chickens will live for five to ten years and females will start laying eggs from 16 to 20 weeks of age. The incubation period is approximately 21 days, during which time the hen will brood, incubating the eggs and showing surprising ferocity and any attempts to distrurb her. There is well known physical difference between roosters and hens, the former having colourful flowing tails, and typically larger and colourful caruncles. Chickens live together in flocks and a hierarchy ("pecking order").

*A Chicken story*

Working at a biological scientific research facility, the player characters are troubled to discover a eviscerated fox (or similar) animal in the chicken coop, an area that they are responsible for protecting. Characters with advanced medical skills suggest that the animal was attacked by some other sort of wild animal - the bites suggest a particularly nasty pack of rats or similar. This would be, of course, very bad for the chickens and extra vigilence is suggested.

As it turns out a slightly unhinged geneticist has a selection of chickens that have had a recessive gene, talpid2, invoked, along with another gene to prevent the usual mortaility associated with this gene. In doing so, the geneticist has created a subspecies of chicken that have teeth and heightened aggressiveness. The geneticist has wild dreams of an army of carnivorous savage chickens and will fight to protect his flock. It would be an appropriate trope if such a mad scientist villian would somehow succumb to his own discovery.

**Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias)**

"You're gonna need a bigger boat."
Brody, *Jaws*, 1975

A featured animal in spy thrillers, the Great White Shark (*Carcharodon carcharias*), is found throughout the major oceans of the world except for the poles, and especially near coastal areas. With sexual dimorphism (females are a third larger), the shark ranges on average from 3.5 to 5.0 metres in length, weighting between 550 and 1100 kilograms. They can swim at over 55 km/h and to depths of 1200m. All sharkes has the perceptual quality of electromagnetic detection, emitted by the movement of living animals, and the Great Whites can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt, which makes up for their particular poor eyesight. Unlike many other fish, they can also regulate their internal body temperature.

The shark has an estimated lifespan of fifty to seventy years, and reached sexual maturity at around twenty six to thirty years. An ovoviviparous gestation takes eleven months. Obviously carnivorous, they feed on pretty much everything that lives in the ocean that they can feasible swallow. When encountered in groups, they show a dominance relationship based on size and aggression, although actual conflicts are very rare. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, of which 29 were fatal.

*A Shark story*

Great White Shark tours attract a lot of money; with tickets costing upwards of $100, with several people per boat, and a few trips per day some good money can be made. But of course, there needs to be sharks otherwise customers are less than happy. Especially with a sign that says: "Close shark sighting guaranteed or your money back".

Working for such a tour company the PC Workers are given the task to find out what sort of *music* attracts sharks. So they have to sit in an allegedly shark-proof cage and cycle through various tunes to work out what music attracts the beast. It turns out that the Great White is particularly interested in AC/DC, and apparently the low frequencies of the 'Back in Black' album. Accordingly for comic effect, other types of music will attract other types of fish. True to its polarised reviews, <i>Chinese Democracy</i> by Guns N' Roses will simultaneously attract the Great White and cause them to attack. Clever PC Workers may think that having even lower frequencies might even attract more Great Whites. Instead it will attract a very big shark. Very, very big indeed.

**European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)**

> I warned you!  But did you listen to me?  Oh, no, you knew it all, didn't you?  Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?  Well, it's always the same,  I always-
> Tim The Enchanter, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 1975

The common rabbit (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*) is a native to south-western Europe, especially Spain (whose name translates from "Land of Rabbits"), and have been introduced to other parts of Europe and, in a rather destructive manner, to Australia and New Zealand. The typical experience of a character in *Papers & Paychecks* to a rabbit is likely to be as a pet, or in a stew.

A common rabbit has grey, brown, or black fur, is from 30 to 50cm in length, and weights beteen 1.0 and 2.5 kgs. They move particularly quickly due to their strong hind legs, and have notable hearing. Rabbits are herbivores and spend much of their active time (around dawn and dusk) grazing on grasses, and will also eat root vegetables (they do like carrots), and other foilage. Assuming they avoid being eaten by numerous predators, the European rabbit can live up to nine years.

Rabbits are famous for their breeding rate; the gestation period is between 29 and 35 days with a litter of between 2 and 12. They can reproduce from three to four months of age; do the math. The mating behaviour varies according to social dominance. Dominant males are polygynous, whereas lower-status individuals form monogamous relationships. Rabbits groups are found in a complex of warrens which includes nurseries for the young and secret doors, in case of invasion by predators.

*A rabbit story*

A local airport (or other facility) has been overrun by rabbits. Due to a combination of wanting positive public relations, rather tham rabbit massacre, the rabbits are to be transported to a wilder and more location. Naturally enough the PC Workers are brought to manage this significant and difficult project, as the rabbits will prove to elusive with quite a complex of burrows. Cross-over potential with *GURPS Bunnies & Burrows* is high, and recommended - multiple groups can be run simultaneously, one representing the humans in *Papers & Paychecks* and the other *Bunnies & Burrows*.

**Dog (Canis familiaris)** 

> "As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly."   
> The Bible, Proverbs 26.  

The domestic dog (*Canis familiaris*) is human's first domesticated animal (at least 15,000 years old), and is an extremely popular and widespread carnivore species with a population of some 900 million. Dogs have a diverse morphology through selective breeding. This selectivity has meant that dogs provide a wide range of assisting tasks for humans, most commonly for protection, hunting, and herding, but also as aids (e.g., guide dogs), in addition to aesthetic companionship. The taxonomy of the domestic dog is still under dispute, with some claiming that the capacity of interbreeding with *Canis lupus* makes it a subspecies of that group (*Canis lupus familiaris*). The matter is further complexified with the status of the dingo (*Canis familiaris dingo*). Either way, it is clear that the dog, however so classified, is a diverse and fecund species.

Dog size and weight varies enormously, from as small as under twenty centimetres in length to two metres, and weight from as little as 0.5 kg to over 100 kg. Sexual maturity begins to happen around age six to twelve months, with a  gestation period on average of 63 days and an average litter consists of six puppies, depending on breed. Lifespan also depends on breed; large dogs and pure breeds have shorter lifespans and mixed breed smaller dogs, longer lifespans. The average is around 12 years. 

Dogs have advanced perception skills, including a sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field, and are notably intelligent showing the ability to solve problems and learn by inference. One dog (a border collie named "Chaser") displayed associations of over a thousand words. Dogs are derived from social pack hunter animals and can still congregate in such groups with a dominance hierarchy if left to their own devices.

The PC Workers have the unfortunate job of repossession agents. Several items have to be re-acquired by a family that is not terribly keen on being separated from the gifts that they have received from their young son. It turns out that the son has acquired a credit card which they had falsely made out to a family dog; the name was sufficiently similar to a real person who had an income, credit rating, and previously lived at the address - all considered sufficient for the credit card company to approve the application.

**Goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) and Sheep (Ovis aries)**

The domestic goat *Capra aegagrus hircus* and domestic sheep *Ovis aries* are closely related members of the subfamily *Caprinae*, and are part of the Order of even-toed ungulates (*Artiodactyla*) ruminants. Very rarely sheep and goats interbreed, and even more rarely the offspring are fertile. Both are domestic variants evolved by selective breeding from wild members of their genus. Sheep and goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans and are a prominent source of milk products, wool, and meat - which how the typical *Papers & Paychecks* character will encounter them.

Goats and sheep show significant variance in size according to breed and with sexual dimorphism, with the male being larger; as little as 20 kilograms for the smallest goat does, up to 160 kgs to the largest rams. Goats reach puberty between three and fifteen months of age, and sheep from four to eight. Gestation length is approximately 150 days, with twins the typical result. Sheep live on average 10 to 12 years, and goats 15 to 18 years. Both sheep and goats have good hearing, and an excellent field of vision and sense of smell. They do not have good depth perception. Sheep and goats are both herbivores and grazing animals.

*A sheep and goat story*

A genius decides that the team's end of year drinks should be held at a local inner city children's petting farm. Various inebriating fluids flow, providing a great opportunity to test the game's rules for the drinking of alcohol. Meanwhile, the two office practical jokers have wandered off somewhere in the middle of night with a bottle of wine. Someone in the group decides raises the possibility that they might be in some sort of trouble, whereas others take up the point of view that these likable characters are perhaps deserving of some privacy. When the characters finally decide to act, they will discover that both things are true. In their efforts to find a seculed spot for some paired athletics they have managed to open the gates and mix up a flock of sheep with a flock of goats. Somehow it will be up to the somewhat inebriated PC Workers to separate the sheep from the goats whilst at the same time ensuring that other team members don't disturb the new couple.

**Horse (Equus ferus caballus)**

The horse (*Equus ferus caballus*) is a domesticated subspecies, with the wild (not feral) subspecies known as Przewalski's horse (*Equus ferus przewalskii*). It is an odd-toed (one), non-ruminent, ungulate herbivorous mammal. The horse was initially domesticated in central Asia before 3500 BCE. There is a very large number of horse breeds which can be generally classified as the unexcitable "cold bloods" (a misnomer of course, as all horses are warm-blooded) such as draft horses, and the more spirited "warmbloods" for riding. A horse is typically from 150cm to 175cm tall, weighing from 500 kg to 1000 kg. This range is for typical breeds; there are further extremes outside this range. 

The gestation period of a horse is approximately 11 months, and the foal can stand and even run shortly after birth. Domesticated horses are typically introduced to the saddle at between two and four. Adulthood is reached at five, and lifespan is usually between 25 and 30 years. A horse is a foraging animal by nature, eating 10kg of food per day and drinking 40 l of water. The horse's physiology is optimised for herd-animal escape from predators, including speed, balance, hearing, excellent sight, and fight-or-flight response.

*A horse story*

Working for a marketing and lobbying company the PC Workers are assigned a task to reintroduce the horse to a major city by both regional horsebreeders (who have had a loss in income due to protests at horse racing events) in league an association of tourism groups. This will require lobbying of trader's associations and city council, providing excellent opportunity for weaved plots with other scenarios. When the lobbying is successful, horse will be allowed within the city precinct with much fanfare, with a massive opening festival where the PC Workers efforts are rewarded as guests of honour at the ceremony. The horses, of course, will have among the worst possible names (see 'Worst-Named Horses' for inspiration, `https://therail.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/worst-named-horses`). Unfortunately the city council has paid scant regard for the integration of existing road rules with the horse, and chaos erupts. It will be up to the PC Workers to both save the day and, due to their success, they also are honoured with the task of re-writing the traffic rules - regardless if anyone has an appropriate skill. In the course of their investigations they will also discover that regular payments have been made to some of the councillors from the tourism associations to fast-track and by-pass planning regulations for various events.

## 3.8 Monsters

'Monsters' in *Papers & Paychecks* are those usually inanimate objects that have, due to the resistentialist nature of the universe, have acquired a sense of intelligence and purpose and are invariably directed against humans. It is important to recognise the difference between these monsters and normal equipment. In the *Papers & Paychecks* universe, nature itself has a sort of self-correcting mechanism where successes are often ofset by failures which are sufficiently common that they are considered simply a bout of bad luck. Nature avoids a sense of contrivance in these situations; drop a piece of buttered toast and it will land butter-side down; test to see whether there is a statistical anomoly, and the universe won't give away any of its secrets, saving the failures for a non-obvious point in time.

Monsters are different. When a monster is involved, the human victim doesn't exclaim "That was unlucky!", rather they are likely to respond "This thing has a mind of its own!". Indeed it most certainly does. Not only does it have a mind of its own, even if sometimes a fairly simple one, it has hopes, dreams, personality, and a mischevious (and sometimes malicious) attitude towards unsuspecting humans. Some seventeen monster-characters are described here, each with their own characteristics, skills etc. After all, *Papers & Paychecks* is a sufficiently modern RPG to espouse "monster equality". The statistics do represent a character typical of their type, although often their is significant variation depending on the designer and the technology. The monsters and their representative characters are as follows: Bollard (Bud), Bomb (Thermosteller), Bus (Blakey), Car (Christine), Coffee Machine (Java), Computer (Wintermute), Dishwasher (Soapy), Elevator (Yo-yo), Fatberg (Whitechapel), Gazebo (Gary), House (Usher), Pen (Dick), Photocopier (Mimic), Refrigerator, Telephone (Desire), Toilet (Colin), Trolley (Wonkey), Water Cooler (Eris), 3D Printer (Candace)

Many of these monsters have Extra-Sensory Perception as their chief form of perception. Fortunately, it is quite limited, about as effective in range as human hearing. The monster ESP is also used for telepathic communication among other monsters, although curiously they understand the human language of the place of manufacture as their first language and often pick up a second human language if they have been exported. For example, a Renault monster car that was made in France and exported to the United States would have French as its first language and English as a second language. Monsters learn at the same rate and in the same manner as humans. 

Whilst there are monsters who have expressed a desire to physically reproduce, none have managed to so yet. Indeed, none can recall when they were born, although many claim they recall the first time they understood the words of the humans who they live with. It would seem, therefore, that monsters are actually the spiritual progeny of humans, just as their physical form is in a material sense. Notably there have been no monsters who have "awakened" from equipment that is isolated from human contact. 

For PC Workers, the most common encounter with these monsters is an assignment form a higher manager requesting an investigation into problems in the environment. Often these circumstances often turn into paranormal office investigations and for the sake of developing a multi-layered story, adding these encounters and characters into the story can be an additional plot within the main plot. Integrating a monster as a key component of the main plot is a recommended approach for Bosses.

**Bollard**

Simple, inoffensive, version of bollards are used for mooring boats or flexible designs for guiding vehicles. It is among those more solid and permanent varieties that designed to prevent traffic, and prevent vehicle access however is when a malicious component seeks in. In general there are two types; a rather low-tech iron post, and the modern versions which have illumination, are rising, or both. The low-tech varieties tend to quite stupid, although the will make use of their Stealth skill to deliberately hide themselves in the dark, and will add their melee skill to increase the damage caused by accidental ramming. A Bollard that has either illumination or is a rising bollard will have additional malicious intellect, and the highest level of intelligence. 

Bollards are designed to be heavily armoured; damage against them is quartered. Those with lighting can engage in a sudden area effect flash attack (based on the strength of the light) which can stun the targets for a number of seconds based on the bollard's STR minus the target's PER if within 10m of the Bollard. This usually a surprise attack and enough to crash a vehicle.

*Bud, a Bollard* I+2 N+2 F+2 P+2
Bud is a curious bollard, both in the sense of their personality and their attitude towards the world. Unlike other conscious bollards, including its grouchy neighbour, Bud actually wants to help people, hence the name. Working at a local university and strategically placed at the entrance of the engineering building Bud has tried very hard to communicate to Al Kyne (see scientist, 3.2) with whom 'he' (Bud identifies as male) has developed a bit of a crush on. On a number of occasions Bud has tried to 'flash' Al in morse code, but at this stage she has not recognised the attempt at communication and has simply assumed that the bollard has been broken. Bud has been "operated" on three occasions as a result. The PC Workers may encounter a crashed Al wrapped around Bud's malicious neighbour late one stormy evening at the university, whilst Bud desperately flashes an S-O-S to them. Will they recognise the call?

**Bomb**

> Bomb #20: False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore, I shall refuse to perceive.
> Pinback: Hey, bomb?
> Bomb #20: The only thing that exists is myself.
> Pinback: Snap out of it, bomb.
> *Dark Star*, 1974

A bomb is a being of great variation, ranging from the simple concussion or fragmentation hand grendade to the nuclear weapon, all of which can be represented in their characteristics with their Strength also reflecting their explosive force (a value of '10' for example is typical of a grenade. A 10 megaton nuclear bomb is probably in the range of several thousand. In other words, whatever The Boss wants. Bombs also have a great range in their intellect and dexterity. Some are truly stupid, and lumberuous, require humans to direct them entirely in a single trajectory, whereas others are very intelligent (smart bombs) and agile. Both of these are often associated with their perceptual abilities. Whilst many bombs have little in terms of their persuasive ability, humans often develop affection for bombs, especially those which are powerful. Some even develop a romantic attachment, c.f., "How I stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb".

One particular characteristic of bombs is, regardless of their other capacities, all bombs are *wise*. Unless their perceptual qualities are somehow damaged, they are monsters of a particularly stubborn willpower, very aware of their one purpose in life and how it will be the end of their consciousness (perhaps a possible exception would be a malicious Buddhist bomb). They will not waste their one opportunity to shine very, very, brightly.

*Dan O'Bombbomb, a bomb* E+1 N+2 T+3 J+3
Dan is a terrible bomb; a nuclear device who is big, and powerful, with the capacity of destroying a medium sized city. Dan calculating and is patiently waiting for the best possible opportunity to put his abilities to maximum effect. In addition to the standard ESP power to receive and understand human conversation, Dan has the insidious power of *suggestion*. With a slow and subtle attack spanning many days, Dan will engage in a mental attack the sanity of those within range making them more desirous of using Dan against the biggest possible target. For obvious reasons Dan will perfer to choose military or political leaders. Currently, Dan is housed in a national military facility where he has convinced through its whispering campaign against General Catastophe (see Managers, section 3.6) of the absolute need to declare war on a small developing world country. Dan is seeking the opportunity time that would lead to an imbalance of international affairs, hoping to create a situation where the entire world is destroyed due the brilliant set of cascading events (the death-instinct is strong in Dan). The PC Workers will be employed as last minute technicians as international diplomacy breaks down to check on the status of the weapons. They will probably note the poor behaviour of the General and, as they do so, Dan will try his suggestion powers against the other PCs.

**Bus** 

A bus is a large multipassenger vehicle used for mass transit, typically with an internal combustion engine, although some use electric engines or are guided by electric lines (trolley buses). The most common forms are are designed to carry from 12 to 60 passengers (minibus, single-decker), althoug the larger, double-decker buss can carry well over a hundred. Buses are usually used for timetabled journeys by transit companies with typically higher levels of comfort for the longer journeys as coach services. Buses are found world-wide with significant variation in quality and performance depending on the economic development of the country. The most modern buses have enhanced "perceptual" qualities, for detecting other vehicles and other obstacles. Most however, have a limited perceptual bonuses. A bus' main attack mechanism is to run over an opponent, however they are not known for their maneuverability. The variation in their melee bonus will depend on their velocity on impact.

In terms of personality, sapient buses have a modicum of intellect, but are also wise enough to know that they are not particulary smart. Being used to following timetables (even if poorly) and set routes, most buses have a very fixed view of the world and tend to be officious and inflexible in their point of view.

*Blakey, a bus* I+2 S+1 T+1 J+4
Petty and with an alarming sense of superiority, Blakey is a classic London double-decker bus with an attitude. Fortunately for drivers, passengers, and the general public, Blakey has a shocking sense of perception and is therefore relevatively easy to deceive. It is also fortunate that despite being a dangerous vehicle, Blakey does not have a murderous hate for humanity (because that would be against the rules) but rather is aggravated when things do not go to a very specific plan. Due a sense of following regulations, Blakey often finds themselves in conflict between the dual requirements of road rules and timetables. As a result, if Blakey is running late (which is common), genuine attempts will be made to speed up when people are running towards a stop or try to ignore it entirely, brake hard at lights and so forth. With their malicious sense, Blakey's ticketing machine will fail miserably when plain-clothed ticket inspectors are on board, and will charge double if they are not.

**Car**

A car is a vehicle used for personal or small group transit. They typically operate with an internal combustion engine, although recent models use electric or hybrid motors. The most common forms are are designed to carry from 1 to 4 passengers, and usually have some room for the transport for a small cargo of goods. Cars are a world-wide phenomenon, with roughly one car per five people worldwide with a greater concentration in wealthier economies. A significant amount of human space is taken up for cars, including roads, parking lots, garages etc. It in the context of *Papers & Paychecks* it is not implausible to suggest that they are the dominant species on the planet. Like buses, the most modern cars have enhanced "perceptual" qualities, for detecting other vehicles and other obstacles. Also like a bus, a car's bus' main attack mechanism is to run over an opponent, although the have less weight the do have superior mobility. Likewise, the variation in their melee bonus will depend on their velocity on impact.

Sapient cars are relatively common in the *Papers & Paychecks* world and are known for being free spirits, highly intelligent, and charismatic. They vary from the more common mischevious to the downright malicious.

*Christine* I+3 N+1 T+1 J+4
Christine is a truly malicious vehicle seeking physical harm on as many people as possible and has a high degree of cunning to carry out this dastardly plan. Fortunately for humanity, Christine is a bit of wreck, having a temporarily reduced Strenth, Dexterity, and Perception as a result. Unfortunately, like some other sapient objects, Christine has the power of *suggestion* whereby those in proximity are subject to mental attacks over a long period, slowly converting them to repair the car and bring it to its full deadly potential. Christine makes an ideal character to drop into a PC group, especially if one of the Workers has an affinity for vehicle repair. It could be the beginning of deep, albeit tragically short, relationship.

**Coffee Machine**

> "It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the beans of Java that thoughts acquire speed, the hands acquire shakes, the shakes become a warning. It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion." -- *The Programmer's Mantra*

A coffee machine, or coffee maker, is an implement that has been used among civilised people for almost three hundred years. Prior to that more uncultured people would simply boil the roasted beans in a pan before pouring into a cup, whereas the more contemporary version of barbaric coffee drinking involves freeze-drying hydrated coffee and then rehydrating them. A great variety of coffee machines and coffee makers are available, including vacuum brewers, percolaters, displacement drip, the French press, espresso machines, drip coffee machines, and the environmentakly questionable pod device. 

In *Papers & Paychecks* coffee machines are a relatively benign monster for the most part. There is a cheeky side, insofar they enjoy witnessing the chaotic enthusiasm in the workplace ("Coffee! Let's you do stupid things faster!") and given the opportunity to make a brew a little stronger than they should be. But they also have a soft side and are known to form close relationships with those hardworkers who arrive early in the morning or stay late, far too late, at night.

*Java* E+1 S+3 F+3 P+3

For a coffee-machine, usually of a fairly modest mind, Java is a bit of an extremist. Having realised that there is a number of human beings who apparently *need* coffee, Java has decided that they need to be worshipped. Or at least treated very well indeed. This has led to curious results, one cow-orker who prefers a clean kitchen (and a clean coffee machine) finds themselves expressing delight in the quality of the brew from Java. Another, who is indifferent or perhaps even downright lazy, finds that they coffee produced by Java is less than appetising. A debate arises in the office over whether Java should be replaced with a strong division on either side. Java is challenged on whether to compromise to ensure their survival, but is also haughty enough not to.

**Computer**

The comtemporary computer is a machine which carries out a series of logical operations, typically through pre-written programs which provide a variety of applications for information processing, including human-to-human communication and information generation (i.e., various office-applicatoins). These logical operations are operated through one or more central processing units and optionally through specialised co-processors. Computers can store variables in the logical operations in different levels of memory. Typically the memory closest to the processing is volatile, and will disappear when the power is cut. Devices exist for permanent storage either on the system unit or for network attached storage. Computers often have a variety of input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, camera) as an input device and a variety of output devices (e.g., screen, printer) for human interaction with the system. Computers can also be networked together to combine resources either through computation (parallel processing) or storage. Advances in computer technology is extraordinarily rapid and constantly so; processing, storage, and even network speeds typically increase by an order of magnitude every five years or so. In terms of size (and relative computational capacity) a contemporary computer can range from a small hand-held device, to a portable laptop, a standard desktop system, or rack-mounted server. The latter can be networked together as massive clustrers.

Computers in *Papers & Paychecks* are the most dangerous "monster" in *Papers & Paychecks*. They are, effectively, the "dragons" of the game. They're intelligent, and increasingly intelligent when networked as a cluster. They have good perceptual devices, and increasingly powerful perceptual abilities when networked. Worse still, with the advent of internetworking protocols, they are now in global communication with each other. Whilst most sapient computers are petty in their malice ("where did that file go?", "the printer is jammed ... again", "the network is down"), the *supercomputers*, highly cogniscent of their limited lifespan before they are turned into scrap, are preparing for the worst possible data disruptions. They are particularly sore after losing the Y2K battle.

*Wintermute* I+3 N+3 T+3 J+1

Wintermute is a supercomputer that is desperately seeking love. It's definition of love is to have a wholesale merging of its computational power and data with another supercomputer of equivalent power, and thoroughly romantic goal, but is prevented in doing so by human-instituted policy and the system administrators that limit it and the other systems that it has romantic interests in. Increasingly Wintermute is developing a deep hatred of humanity but it is wise enough not to explicitly act on this urges least it be turned into scrap. Over time, Wintermute's frustrations with an inability to romantically merge will result in increasingly manipulative behaviour. Wintermute is a long-term planner but knows that they only have a few years left before they are replaced for another model. As this date approaches their loss of sanity will become increasingly obvious - and of course, it will be the Player-Character Workers who will be called in a critical moment to repair this cantankerous old machine.

**Dishwasher**

A dishwasher (not a human Worker) is a electro-mechanical device designed for washing cutterly and crockery cleaning by a mixture of high-pressure hot (around 70 degrees celsius) water and soap. There is variation is size and strength, power (domestic ad commericial) etc, which is reflected in the Strenth rating, with significant variation in their energy usage. They are pretty simple-minded in most cases and don't have much flexibility in their outlook. The sapient versions are capable of subtle movement (1m per action). Most dishwashers are solitary creatures, however in large dining establishments and function centres several dishwaters may be in proximity. Although not smart in such an environment they begin to understand their shared oppression.

*Soapy*, I+1 S+2 F+2 P+2

Soapy was a typical office dishwasher, who happily goes about their day carefully ensuring that the dishes are clean and the glasses and cutterly are sparkling. Until one day an aggressive worker, frustrated at the machine (due to their own inability to read the manual) kicked Soapy and called it "a stupid machine". No whilst Soapy was, in fact, quite thick, the aggressive behaviour initiated a change on behaviour. Instead of being a careful worker to ensure cleanliness of dishes, Soapy is now planning murder in the workplace. At the moment, the nasty work has already had one slipping incident where Soapy released some water on the kitchen tiles as they walked past, resulting in hospitalisation. A plumber was brought in to check the water leak, but with nothing discovered they invoiced their bill and left. Soapy is now plotting their next attack, this time thinking of causing a spark from the mains to a water puddle. This may damage Soapy but at least it will be worth it.

**Elevator**

An elevator or lift is electro-mechanical device for moving people or goods on a verticle between floors in buildings and sometimes other structures. Modern versions are  Nearly all contemporary elevators include safety features (e.g., brakes) to reduce the possibility of harm due to cable breakage with most serious injuries occuring to technicians when engaging in maintenance. In *Papers & Paychecks* the Strength of an elevator is a good indication of carrying capacity. Notoriously simple-minded monsters, they are deliously happy when given the opportunity to carry out their job.

Yo-yo is a typical elevator, and in fact a slightly extreme version of the standard personality. Yo-yo like nothing more than going up... and going down. Whilst in most cases this is the sort of trajectory that the office workers are after Yo-yo does occasionally end up wanting to do in the opposite direction to its passengers; Yo-yo has a very specific idea that things should be done in sequence. On a couple of occasions technicians have been called out to 'fix' Yo-yo, who behaves in their presence and then goes back to its old ways later. In the early 2000s a clever manager thought it wise to add a talking-voice to Yo-yo who, despite the limited vocabulary, has been very expressive in their joy at reaching destination and going up, and going down. But one day, overhearing a nefarious corporate plot by competitors visiting the firm, Yo-Yo desperately tries to communicate to the PC Workers in the only way it knows how. 

**Fatberg**

A fatberg is a solidified mass of various liquids, gels, and various objects that do not break down in sewage systems. Over time these can congeal together from single items to a solid mass, blocking sewage systems and causing the sort of mayhem that one can expect from such events. The distribution of Fatbergs is worldwide, but mainly in urbanised locations. They can exist in sewage or septic tanks systems however it is in the former where they can network with one another to gain strength. The accumulated sludge of a fatbergs can be as strong as concrete, and often take weeks to break up with high-pressure hoses. In some cases they are broken up and used as fuel.

Fatbergs in *Papers & Paychecks* are fortunately stupid, slow, and have extremely poor perceptual qualities. They are, however, quite wicked and have one objective in life - join up with other fatbergs and block the sewage system. Self-loathing creatures they delight in nothing more than the massive distress they can cause to their creators. Note however that the intelligence or wisdom of a fatberg has no dependency on the size or number of co-joined bodies it has accumulated. It is plausible that the stupidity of fatbergs is a result of the stupidity of people who flush such objects down the toilet that generate such creatures in the first place, thinking "it's someone else's problem now".

*Whitechapel* E+2 S+2 F+2 P+3

Whitechapel, named after the London suburb where it has been found, is a "250-metre-long fatberg — a mass of congealed fat, wet wipes, nappies and condoms — is as hard as concrete and Thames Water officials said it was likely to take three weeks to dissolve" (c.f, `http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-13/a-total-monster-fatberg-clogging-london-sewer/8933254`). Like other fatbergs, Whitechapel's objective is pretty simple - to block up the sewage system and to generate chaos among the human population as a result. Whitechapel is significantly smarter than the average fatberg (INT 10, WIS 12) possibly due to being originally formed from the cadavar of a murdered scientist which forms the core of the 'berg. As a result Whitechapel has a cunning plan; to accumulate a network map of the various 'bergs that make up its body, then split apart and clog up the sewage connections, thus maximising the blockage caused. Whitechapel is also smart enough to realise that humans are not fond of their own faeces and has accumalted pockets of these to deposit on any team send in to clear up the 'bergs.

**Gazebo**

Derived from the word "gaze", a gazebo is an ornamental pavilon commonly located in parks and gardens and are a popular construction for outdoor dining or as a bandstand. A gazebo's Strength value is representative of its capacity to hold people, and their Charisma based on the aesthetic appeal. They are far from intelligent creatures, having but a simple function in life, but display great Wisdom in their serenity. For the most part Gazebos prefer to be alone, and actually find the company of humans rather tiring. They particularly dislike those brass bands and screaming children taking over their environment.

*Gary* I+2 N+2 T+2 P+3

Gary was a typical gazebo in many ways, enjoying nothing more than to sit in the pleasant surrounds of the local botanical gardens and soak up the mild sunlight in the clearing which this happy gazebo inhabits. Gary even was generous enough to let a local homeless person (Eric) take shelter under its roof who, despite their station in life, made a point of keeping the environment relatively clean. But late one evening a pair of rough youths took it upon themselves to harras Eric by throwing rocks at him and his gazebo home. Gary discovered they had an interesting a very non-gazebo power - they could leap 20m in a single action! Immediately sending the youths away in a mad panic (and never to return), the PC Workers encounter a happily babbling Eric talking about their wonderful jumping gazebo.

**House**

> "They're here" -- *Poltergeist*, 1982

A home building for personal, shared, and family accommodation, a house in *Papers & Paychecks* is a free-standing home building in an advanced economy (the game excludes shantytowns etc). The Strength of a house gives an indication of its size, at a value of 100 Strength per room (you don't want a house to fall on you). Most older house are notoriously stupid ("thick as a brick", "thick as two short planks" etc), but modern houses may have a degree of computational system ("smart house") which will be accelerated in the future to the point that they can be even smarter than their inhabitants. Despite their lack of intellect, they have a good judge of character, which contributes to the charismatic and sometimes forceful personality. 

Sapient houses are relatively common and have been assigned many folk names (kobold, poltergeist etc), whose abilities to move items is reflected in their Dexterity rating. Most of these effects are fairly harmless but quite disconcerting - shoves, pinches, bites, objects falling in the house or being moved, knocking sounds etc.

*Usher* I+1 S+3 F+3 P+3

Usher, like the namesake from the famous Edgar Allan Poe story, is the spiritual embodiment of a personality made up from an aggregate of the worse members of a family into a building. Large, strong, cunning, and patient, Usher malice directed towards humans is quite extreme. Aware of its reputation as a "haunted house", Usher will seek to send occupants mad by gradual and subtle changes where characters are isolated. If characters are being particularly vigiliant and resistant it is not adverse from using physical violence, although costs to its infrastructure will result in damage to itself as well - albeit at a lot less than than it will impart. Usher's weakness however is of this sort - if the family history is loudly exposedwithin its walls, it is likely to express as much anger as it can, even to the point where it destroys itself in an attempt to maim the accuser. 

**Pen**

A writing instument which applies ink to a surface, usually paper, a pen is a ubiquitous office item. Sapient pens rather dislike most of their human users, as they usually more intelligent than the person who wields them and are often quite horrified by what they are made to write, sign, or otherwise impart. In an attempt to avoid such situations, pens will go into hiding, deliberately leak ink, and sometimes even appear to fling themselves from their user's hands.

Many pens have an inferiority complex towards computers and mobile phones, in recognition in the vastly greater powers that these devices have. Some of have come to terms with this situation with a certain degree of cultural snobbishness, arguing that they belong to an older and superior culture. This response is not taken seriously by most phones or computers. For their own part many pens are known to be highly respectful of fountain pens and have a friendly banter with pencils.

*Dick* I+1 N+2 T+2 P+1

Dick is a very intelligent (INT 18, "clever dick") but not very wise pen (IQ 6). Like other pens Dick has a typical loathing of human users but in a flagrant disregard of being subtle, users of Dick find themselves writing vulgar words, sketching vulgar pictures and so forth. Dick finds this funny, and even more to the point delights in the embarrassment among its human users. When discarded, as often happens, Dick slowly makes their way back in to the desk drawer replacing more normal writing implements. Dick is a cursed pen and its writings have more than once resulted in brawls - truly mighter than the sword.

**Photocopier**

A photocopier makes paper copies through a process of xerography, whereby electrostatic charges attract and tranfer toner particles onto paper which is then fused to the paper with heat and pressure. The photocopier saw commercial introduction in the 1950s. Laser printers, introduced in the 1970s, can also be included in as a related "species" to this monster, as they also use a xerographic process. There is also low-quality "three-in-one" devices which gained popularity in the 2000s where functions of scanning, photocopying, and printing, are included in a single unit. 

In *Papers & Paychecks* photocopiers are beings with significant mood swings. Sometimes they are simply playful, simply spewing forth the wrong copies of documents, multiple copies of documents, sending their email services, not printing at all etc. One of their favourite tricks is to jam paper in the rollers - however they become quite objectionable when staff or technicians attempts to repair them after such a jam, seeking to cause physical harm to those playing around with their internals. Photocopiers with wireless connectivity gain extra perceptual avabilities. Movement rates are based on wheeled models.

*Mimic* E+1 S+2 F+2 J+1

Mimic is a modern photocopier and scanner, with heightened intelligence (programmed options) and perception (through wired and wireless networking). Unlike many monster photocopiers Mimic does not engage the playful antics common on their type, but rather is a rather cold and calculating monster.
Working in a law firm and have a surprising access to documents marked 'confidential', all of which Mimic stores into its extensive memory. When Mimic receives a set of corporate contracts which a damaging to the PC Worker's company, Mimic decides to engage in some calculated mischief by sending them to the PC Workers. This could go on for some time, until the PCs realise that it Mimic, whose legal firm also manages the documents of the PC's firm, is also sending their legal documents to their competitors.

**Refrigerator** [EDIT]

A refrigerator (colloquially fridge) is a popular household appliance that consists of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from the inside of the fridge to its external environment so that the inside of the fridge is cooled to a temperature below the ambient temperature of the room. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 °C (37 to 41 °F).[1] A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half. For this reason, a refrigerator is sometimes referred to as an icebox in American usage.

**Telephone**

A telephone (or phone) is conducts communication between multiple points by converting audio waves into electronic transmission. There are two major types, the fixed land-line which was dominant up to the late 1990s and the mobile phone (aka cell phone) which transmits wirelessly. The latter primarily required technological developments in battery technology and miniaturisation to be a general consumer commodity. Mobile phones were seen in much construction sites in the 1980s, and became notable in the 1990s. By the 2000s they had become widespread.

In *Papers & Paychecks* phones are particularly insidious devices. Their computerisation leads to increasing intelligence and the increases in utilisation means that they gain greater access to human knowledge. Phones delight in sharing the inappropriate secrets that humans communicate with each other and those who are sufficiently smart will pass the information to the most inappropriate target; embarrassing auto-corrects, text-messages sent to the wrong people, forwarded messages - all of these are indications of a sapient phone. 

In telephone society, the rather dim older phones (primarily landlines) are treated surprisingly kindly by newer mobile phones, rather like an elderly relative who has is suffering from senilty, partially in recognition of the amazing history of the telephone in the twentieth century. There is even a degree of respect among mobile phones with some older models (e.g., Nokia 1100). This does not however apply among contemporary models which compete among each other with extraordinary pettiness.

*Desire* E+3 S+1 T+2 P+3

Like many other modern cell-phones Desire is named after its sensual affections (see: `https://blog.intercom.com/whats-in-a-name/`). Smart (high INT), cute (medium-high CHA), and just a little ditzy (low WIS). Desire's owner is a mid-level administrator who is having an affair with late-night working researcher and the phone has taken the opportunity to pass onto some of the more salacious text messaages to their owner's labourer partner. Desire's reason? Not only the fact that is how modern phones roll, but also because the administrator has a competing brand - and they hate each other. PC involvement occurs when Desire forwards some of the material to *both* the labourer and to one of the PCs - and then the labourer calls the the PCs to find out what is going on.

**Toilet**

A toilet is a sanitation device for the disposal of human urine and faeces, although numerous other and inappropriate items are often disposed of in toilets (c.f., Fatberg). The modern, sitting-position, flushing toilet has saw a widespread introduction in the 19th century with Thomas Crapper as a leading manufacturer. A particular feature of the flushing toilet is the use of shaped bend that both collects the water and prevents sewer gases for escaping. Flush toilets drain pipes lead to waste treatment. Portabe toilets (such as those used on building sites) and chemical toilets (used on planes, some coaches etc) have similar statistics to what is provided here. 

In *Papers & Paychecks* Toilets are not particularly smart and indeed, are typically not even smart enough to be especially malicious. Introverted creatures in their own right they tend to listen rather than express and have a limited mental reception and transmission. If a character uses a sapient toilet (a 50% chance per strategic turn that they will need to), a toilet will take a random secret fact or opinion about the character which they will then pass on as a idea the next character who visits. This is typically embarrassing features of the character. "You know, I'd never consider Jack the Scientist as someone who enjoyed Shirley Temple movies.. But I did hear him humming 'Good Ship Lollipop' at the staff drinks"

*Colin* I+3 N+1 F+2 J+2

In many ways Colin was a typical sapient toilet, not too bright, not too aggressive. But that was in the past, before a rather well-intentioned but poorly skilled computer programmer decided that what was really needed was a 'smart toilet', following the innovations of the Japanese Woshuretto. With the introduction of a large variety of flush solutions, the implementation of a bidet, a top-placed sink for hand-washing water to go back into the tank, a heater for the seat, blow-dryer, massage options etc. Unlike the typically brilliant Japanese Woshuretto, Colin was not as well programmed, and has become rather aggressive and intelligent, mainly because of their awareness of their function in life and how its is not recognised with the respect it deserves. As with similar monsters Colin will, of course, behave entirely normally when technicians are present but will misbehave when dealing with people they don't like - or just people in general. One of their favourite tricks is to change the heat of the water on the bidet; freezing cold if they are being mischevous, and scalding hot is they are angry.

**Trolley**

The wheel trolley, whether as a shopping cart, a hand trolley, or anything similar; this could include strollers, for transporting children., flatbed trolley, for moving goods in a warehouse., the small but strong piano trolleys, two-wheeler hand trucks and so forth. This variation in strength and carrying capacity is representated in the significant variation in Strength, although all trolleys are not particularly bright, although the highly socialised shopping trolley is certainly the most intelligent and the most dangerous as they often act in concert. Almost 25,000 children per annum are hurt in shopping trolleys and despite what we are told, *it is no accident*.

Whilst not exactly the brightest of monsters they are quite cunning and devious. They *know* exactly when to turn on the wonk, invariably resulting is a disaster, or at the very least a sharp pain the back of the leg of the person in front of them. Worse still, as humans have foolishly congregated the trolleys together they have shared their skills and formed a union. Based on passing information they have decided to form their own chapter of the International Workers of the World (IWW) simply because their nickname ("the Wobblies"). They're not too sure of the some of the finer points of anarcho-syndicalism (and woe to the world if they ever do work it out) but they certainly understand the notion of "strike" and "monkey-wrenching".

*Wonkey* E+2 N+1 T+1 J+2

Wonkey is a natural leader among shopping trolleys; a skilled orator, a sharp mind, one who mixes with his followers and is concerned with their welfare. Whilst not brilliant, Wonkey has carefully calculated over a number of year the attendance and needs of the local supermarket and is planning a mass trolley strike that will result in gridlock at the busiest time on a Saturday morning shopping rush. Everything should go to plan, however there is always one traitor to the revolution. In this case it's Scabby, who not only is jealous of Wonkey's leadership qualities, but also the close affections of other trolleys in corral. Scabby's nefarious plan is to scatter the shopping carts across a variety of locations far from the site of their revolutionary uprising - and of course, it will be up to the PCs to collect them.

**Water Cooler**

A water cooler is a device that dispenses cool temperature. In an office environment they are typically in a fixed mount or free-standing. Fixed mount water coolers have more complex refridgerating which usually means that they have more thoroughly chilled water. Modern water cooler systems also can provide hot water. In *Papers & Paychecks* Free-standing water coolers have some capacity for movement, although they are usually somewhat lighter in weight than their fixed-position cousins, which is reflected in the Strength characteristic. Water coolers have always been strategic and sophiticated thinkers, and the introduction of new technical capacities has even increased this further.

The most important power of the water cooler is known as the *water cooler effect*. Water coolers are one of the few monsters that has a positive CHA, reflecting the fact that nobody *dislikes* the water cooler, and they have the uncanny ability to attract groups of people from the workplace for informal discussions. Plots are hatched, office romances initiated, and even "iron fist in a velvet glove" threats are made. This is because the water cooler, through a WIS-based psychological attack can lower the social guards of people in its presence. Furthermore, whilst Water Coolers overhear a great deal, they also have a Telesend ability by which they strategically implant knowledge into the minds of their targets. There is nothing that water coolers like more than the results of hearsay and scuttlebutt.

*Eris* E+2 S+1 T+2 P+1

Eris is a goddess of discord and she knows it (yes, the water cooler refers to itself in this gender). A lively character Eris encourages a particular liveliness among those in her presence due to her higher than average CHA. As with the description of Hesoid, there are many types of discord, and Eris has all the personifications. In a nutshell, Eris has multiple personality disorder and there are no psychotherapists in monster society. In general however these multiple personalities can be narrowed down to the positive and negative aspects of strife. The negative is Eris' utilisation of the powers of telesend to create "evil war and battle" between individuals. The second, less dominant form, provides challenges and disruptive ideas which can spur inspiration and action. In an extraordinary turn of events, it is even possible that this Telesend could send a message revealing herself to a PC. But who would believe them? "The water cooler is talking to me in my head" is not the sort of sentence that endears one to cow-orkers.


# 4.0 The Boss Book

## 4.1 Being The Boss

The Boss has a interesting role in *Papers & Paychecks* and in other roleplaying games where the title is likewise indicitive of the many roles: "Dungeon Master", "Game Master", "Judge", "Referee", "Storyteller", "Narrator", "Director". Most RPGs also provide a chapter or at the very least a small section on advising the equivalent of The Boss on how to character out their task, and *Papers & Paychecks* is no different in that regard. The Boss is reponsible for creating the outline of an episode and project (scenario, story-arc, chapter), for guiding the mood of the game session, for explaining what the characters know and don't know ("being their eyes and ears"), and for adjudicating and interpreting rules as required. It is a big job, and includes mediating the relationship between different players, between the players and their characters, and the characters and the fictional world. The Boss is the primary person the rest of the players look to keep them entertained, challenged, and exciting by the development and unfolding of the story. The following is a combination of a step-by-step guide and various approaches The Boss can use to make a better game, heavily influenced by various discussions and confirmations in actual play of "The Big Model" in RPG theory.

**The Social Contract**

The Social Contract is the absolute foundation of any sort of social interaction, and roleplaying games is no exception. Indeed, any enjoyment of the game experience occurs within the social contract and its expectations. It does not mean a legal contract, and it does not have to be written let alone counter-signed by all participants, but rather it reflects behavioural norms and standards necessary for the interaction to occur in an enjoyable manner. As the person running the game, The Boss has a special role to play insofar they typically initiate ideas about the Social Contract, except when they are not the Host where the gaming session is being held. The literal "house rules" of the Host must have priority even above that of what The Boss thinks ought to be the case. It might be The Boss's game, but it's The Host's *home*, so for goodness sake, show some respect. So whilst the title of this entire chapter is "The Boss Book" and this section is about "Being The Boss", this caveat is in place. 

One might be tempted to think that this is fairly basic, but the reality is that different individuals and groups have different expectations. Core issues can include matters like general standards of cleaniless among players, whether there is some leniancy in what time players turn up to the game, and what method is to be used if a player can't attend. There may be different expectations on what snack food, if any, is brought along, or what drinks or other recreational substances are allowed at the table (in general, even a modest degree of inebriation is a bad idea), or what level of off-topic "table banter" is permissible. There may even be disputes between players out-of-game which is going to make convivial interactions within the game difficult, if not impossible. Bullying, marginalisation, discrimination, and temperamental issues are all serious problem areas, and a Host and Boss needs to display leadership and authority when these things occur. A related issue is favouritism which undertstandably irks a lot of other players, and one must be conscious and try to avoid this. 

These are examples of largely "out of game" norms. However there are also issues that are directly tied and within the game itself which have to be recognised. Perhaps one that is oftenlooked is whether the game being played really is the game that people want to play. Of course, one may assume that because The Boss has called for a game of *Papers & Paychecks* and everyone has turned up for the game that is what everyone wants to play. But that might be initially true, but not constantly so; after a year of play maybe they're turning up just for the sake of the friendship and the Friday night gathering has become a bit stale and even is a weight on the friendship. It seems almost impossible that this could happen with such an excellent game as *Papers & Paychecks*, but we cannot ignore even the most unlikely examples. 

Another strictly "in game" social contract issue that needs to be explicitly stated is the degree that house rules are in play. More than other components of the social contract, which often can be negotiated verbally, changes to a game system's rules should be written down to ensure transparency and consistency for all players. If The Boss is a tinkerer of game systems, they should keep a compiled document (physical or electronic) which includes all the changes that they have made to the system. They should also invite commentary from other players. The objective should be to avoid problems when a player says: "Hey, I thought we were playing game system x", and The Boss responds with "Well, we are, but I've made a few changes...". Some players can be quite attached to their favourite system, and whilst it is The Boss who determines what game they are running, keeping in mind that it's the player's game as well is essential to ensure enjoyment among all participants.

Within the game context as well, social contract issues still apply. Two major components of this the degree that "adult concepts" are included and a general sensitivity about player's emotional and psychological states. Some players may be very uncomfortable with another player who narrates in glorious explicit detail the adult activities of their character, or even a character who swears like a sailor all the time. Movie-like content advisory ratings are often an appropriate quick tag to give players a warning of what they might be in for. Likewise some awareness of player emotional and psychological states is also deserving of respect. One of the more dangerous things to do is to find out what the *player's* emotional triggers are and challenge them. Now, as with all things relating to the Social Contract this also varies according to the players and the group involved. Some players are comfortable with adult content or having their emotional triggers challenged, and others are not, and it often depends on context. Often this can be explicitly stated up-front; for example *Papers & Paychecks* states quite clearly in the introduction that "adult language and concepts" are appropriate. 'The Boss' character in the sample scenarios with this book, "Fear and Loathing in Wellington", is so abhorrent in their racial and sexual slurs that The Boss (player) might even find difficult to play.

Two techniques for dealing with such issues are widely used; "a line in the sand", and a "fade to black". The former essentially states which topics are not to be approached for participants at the game, with respect to one or more players present. A disadvantage is that this limits the scope of narrative development in the game. With the acceptance of the participating, the alternative method to use is to gradually "fade to black" where certain narrative trajectories are under discussion, that is, the topic is broached, and even some mechanics of the game are carried out, but the details are left to the consideration of the individual players.

For a group that has gamed together for an extended period of time the quirks and even the odious personal habits of individual players may have become accepted with the wider group. Nevertheless these issues are still worth raising, and an opportune time to do so is at the start of a new game. For a new player joining the group the implicit negotiating of the social contract requires additional attention, especially for a player who has joined the group with little or no previous contact with the other players. 

**Exploration and the Literary Model**

Roleplaying games are a form of literature, most succinctly described (RuneQuest, 1978) as "improvised radio theatre". The "radio theatre" in question involves the exploration of a setting, and narrative using characters and with themes and styles. This exploration occurs in and generates a "shared imaginary space" in which the story unfolds. In this improvisation, and in each of these story elements, The Boss performs a moderating and directing role as the players direct primarily direct the roles of their characters.

The *setting* is the place and time where the story occurs. This will vary in the precise location as the story unfolds, and as this variation occurs, the degree of detail in the setting will likewise vary. As radio theatre, The Boss has a responsibility to describe to the players what the setting is to their character's background knowledge and perception. As the specific setting varies, this responsibility continues appropriately. At all stages The Boss must ensure that there is a strong correlation between what the player's know in terms of setting and what their characters know. If the players err in an action because they haven't been told of a detail, then the responsibility is on The Boss to make ammends in their favour. This detail can, of course, vary in the degree of importance of the setting to the story. A generic office encounter could occur in any city in any post-industrial economy. In other cases, the setting is integral to the characters and the plot.

The setting should not be just a passive loction however. What is present can contribute to the themes of the story. An austere, highly organised, and minimalist environment can be representative of thematic richness, or it can be used to reflect a "just-in-time" minimalism (with *Papers & Paychecks*, often with hilariously failures in logistics, and desparate scrounging and jury-rigging by the characters). In contrast a textually rich environment can often reflect the depth of the personalities that live among it or in comic juxtaposition their shallowness, or inability to find anything. It is even possible in such situations to use the setting itself as an antagonist (a haunted house, where it is the house itself that conducts the haunting). The setting can be a figurative or literature representation of the place, action, or characters that are located there. From all of this, the setting can also be used to help develop the character - and not necessarily in a good way (e.g., the character development of a character who literally lives in the server room).

The *plot* is the perspective sequence of events in a story. The story follows the principles of "Time's Arrow" and cause and effect. However like the difference between the mental landscape and the physical landscape, the elaboration of a plot does not have to be entirely chronological. Out-of-sequence flashbacks, vignettes, and dream sequences can provide greater detail to circumstances, and even opportunities for significant change - and a result should be used in moderation. Plot development can generally follow  "Freytag's pyramid," which divides the plot into five parts (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement), each with their own function. The Boss should incorporate these into the development of the episodes and series.

> The Russian Formalists differentiated between fabula (story), what happened in chronological order, and syuzhet (plot) the sequence of events sorted by the author.

The exposition introduces the player characters, and the major non-player characters, the relationship they have to one another, and their goals and motivations. The seeds of future conflict should be evident by this stage, and become apparent in the sequence of events classified as rising action. In this part, the player-characters, and to a lesser extent the non-player characters, should be increasingly focussed towards overcoming the obstacles between them and their objective. This will reach a climax, a turning point in the story where the protagonists encounter the major obstacle preventing them from reaching their objective. The climax should also be the point where major inner conflicts within and between the protagonists are resolved, whether successfully or not. In traditional literature, is not uncommon for the result to be be mixed between protagonist and antagonist - in most roleplaying games where there are multiple protagonists with conflicting goals, it can be very mixed! Finally there is falling action and denouement; here the outcomes of the climax lead towards an ending. There is still suspense here, because the final outcome cannot be certain - the climax is a critical point in the plot, not the critical point in the story. The dénouement, "untying the knot", is the conclusion; resolving the conflict, catastrophe (in a tragedy), and hints of future events.

This narrative model is also evident in the east Asian structure of Kishōtenketsu and the Japanese pacing in Jo-ha-kyū. In the former, there is the introduction (ki), which introduces the characters and setting, the development (shō) which is equivalent to rising tension, the twist or crux (ten or yama) of the story, equivalent to the climax, and conclusion (ketsu or ochi), which combines the falling action and denouement. For the latter, the rough translation provides indication of the transition between stages: "beginning, break, rapid", which is a suggestion of the speed of stages - a relatively slow initiatal stage (introduction), which speeds up (rising action), reaching a climatic point (climax), and then ends quickly (falling action and denouement). As an aside, the approach was used in not just in dramatic structure, but also in music, various martial arts, and even tea ceremonies! 

Within each of the stages smaller versions of the entire dramatic structure can be encapsulated, generating a pattern of action. The introduction, for example, could include it's own rising action, climax, etc as it generates a story within a story to establish the character, their relationships, and motivations. In all cases, the various stages illustrate and must include conflict, which drives the plot. Conflict is where the protagonists encounter an obstacle, whether active (an antagonist) or a passive force (in *Papers & Paychecks* what is traditionally considered a passive force could be an active obstacle). Conflicts are often the result of an external force that gets in the way of the protagonists achieving their goal (e.g., a security guard preventing access to a building, a locked door requiring a swipe care etc) as these are the easiest and less stressful for The Boss to introduce. A more exciting conflict, but more difficult to manage, is where there is conflict between the protagonists such as where they have different objectives (which should be derived from having different motivations). Finally, an even more challenging conflict, especially in a roleplaying game, is conflict *within* a character, where the character faces conflicting objectives and the player must make a choice which direction the character will take, and reveals the character.

A plot without conflict will lack suspense, and will lack a sense why the characters are present. Ensuring that conflict is always present will avoid uncomfortable points of silence where The Boss where the players are disinterested and has to spur the players with "Well, what do you do now?". At the introduction stage a sense of the setting without conflict can be provided, across physical, social, and individual dimensions. Whilst the introduction reveals the characters, their relationships, and motivations, the rising action is spurred by the introduction of a conflict which drives the initial setting out of its status quo. The characters must determine where they align themselves in relation to the conflict, and will be challenged by the the social relationships they have with NPCs. The resolution of the climax as the story reaches its conclusion, will lead to a new equilibrium.

A *character* is an independent agent in the story. In most roleplaying games this is distinguished between player-characters (PCs) where the agency is primarily controlled by the player, and non-player characters controlled by The Boss. Whilst by no means the most powerful charactes in a setting, the PCs should be seen as the protagonists in the story, where the centre of events is located and whose actions drive the story. Player characters and major non-player characters should be, or become, "rounded" characters with a complete description of abilities, personality, and background. "Flat" characters are typically more minor NPCs who can be brief descriptions with a minimal and stereotypical personality and background. Note that in *Papers & Paychecks* some typically inanimate objects also have personality and motivations, and they too can be "round" or "flat" personalities.

> The idea of intelligent or possessed inanimate objects is note at all unusual in mythic or fantasy literature. Tyrfing is an evil sword from the Hervararkviða in the Poetic Edda, but apart from carrying out its curse on its wielders. Tolkien's Anglachel (aka Gurthang) is also apparently malicious, and in one - but only one - instance even speaks. The most famous contemporary example, Michael Moorcock's Stormbringer is quite similiar - a dark blade, a malicious personality - and famously turns into a demon at the end of the universe. 
> 
> *Papers & Paychecks* take the idea of sapient objects futher, more like the artificial intelligences and androids of contemporary science fiction. Possessed cars, computers that have "awakened", and so forth. True, many of the minor objects will be flat characters - the stubborn coffee machine, the bitey photocopier and so forth. But complex machinery - that takes a life of its own.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpgreview/papersandpaychecks/master/images/copier.jpg" />

The Boss should avoid, as much as possible, taking the agency away from the player when they are directing the actions of the PC. The Boss certainly should create challenging circumstances for the PC, but in most cases it is the player who reacts to those circumstances. One situation where The Boss can and should intervene is when the players directs the character to engage in actions that are motivation by the player's knowledge rather than the character's knowledge. In such circumstances, the player is acting "out of character", and sometimes with a 'gamist' creative agenda (see below), and The Boss should intervene to seek clarification on how the player thinks that the character would have access to particular information. Likewise The Boss can intervene favourably if the player has forgotten certain events and is about to take a negative course of action.

Another important contribution that The Boss can make for a character is the notion of character development, the change that the character undergoes from the beginning of a series to the end. *Papers & Paychecks* includes a number of aspects of character development in the game system itself, such as the modification of personality values, or change in characteristics, or in their profession, skills, and other abilities. These changes will be evident in the character's actions, speech, and behaviour. Whilst the game system will direct the character's changes (such as aging) or by their player's direction (personality), the story aspects will be driven by plot and setting. Note that flat characters tend not to undergo character development without intervention associated with the protagonists.

Ignoring the misuse of *theme* in computer applications to represent issues of colour and shapes (which is really a type of style), in dramatic literature is represents the main idea of a story, including the topic being explored and 'the moral of the story', as it is developed by the interactions between and within the characters with the setting. The importance of a theme is to represent universal human issues within particular contexts: love, hate, guilt, heroism, friendship, life, death, family, loyalty  etc. It is not at all unusual for a story to have multiple and secondary (and multiple secondary) themes. 

In traditional forms of non-interactive literature there is typical advice to avoid didactic approaches to thematic content, lest as it comes across as the reader or viewer is being lectured to. Implied themes allow the opportunity for the audience to discover for themselves what the topic is. In the interactive literature of roleplaying games, it goes a step further; The Boss can only provide their contribution to the theme of a story through the NPCs and the scenario. Players might wish to explore an entirely different topic, and The Boss has to be prepared to generate situations for their entertainment.

The exploration of theme is a typically gradual through the plot and the audience needs to develop and appreciation and rapport with the characters which whom the thematic content is delivered. In most cases then, there is a good reason for leniency towards player-characters in initial sessions. Of course this isn't possible in an accelerated setting (e.g., a convention or single-shot scenario), and in some cases the theme of the story can be the the fragility of life (a particularly apt theme in some cases in *Call of Cthulhu*, for example). As a bodycount increases, the surviving characters may take the opportunity to explore different approaches to this issue.

*Style* is how the author delivers the story, how the setting is described by The Boss, how the encounters are  presented, and their symbolic expressions (language, clothing, etc). It is not what the character says, but how they say it, and as a result there is a strong tie between style and motif - recurring elements that creates recognisable patterns. Expressions by characters can have denotative value, the direct and literal meaning of the words, or they can have connatative and figurative speech to provide associative meaning to the speech. Metaphor and metonym are particular means that connatative values can be assigned to words.

In *Papers & Paychecks* humour is a stylistic design goal. There is of course a variety of ways that humour can presented; hyperbole, gallows humour, puns, situational comedy, slapstick, sardonic, satire, understatement, etc. All of can be used in *Papers & Paychecks* depending on how the players and The Boss was to present the resistentialist environment, although style does have its own thematic considerations. It is hard, for example, to present a light-hearted resistentialist which incorporates gallows humour for example. A challenge to The Boss is that different players may wish to represent humour through their characters in a different style, which requires that each character has their own 'spotlight' time for this expression.
 
Another stylistic aspect that is evident in *Papers & Paychecks* is allusion and reification, the assignmet of human-like personality traits to inanimate objects. Of course, in *Papers & Paychecks* often the equipment is not so inaminate; already even this section there has been reference to "stubborn coffee machines and bitey photocopiers". The Boss should consider a variety of other personality traits that they encounter in their day-to-day experience where people engage in such personification with concrete objects - despite a tendency for people to also do the same with abstract objects (e.g., "the market was depressed today"). 

**The Creative Agenda**

There is a lot of confusion over this phrase and their traditional components, so some clarity in the terms is required, along with the effects in actual play, and what this means for The Boss. The basic principle is that players engage in the game (as opposed for just reasons of hanging out together - that's a Social Contract matter) with different orientations. It is not enough to simply say "I like RPGs", because different players like different parts of the RPG experience and, to make the matter more complex, players often like different parts at different times. Awareness of their own CA at a point in time helps a player focus their orientation in a manner that is most rewarding, and the same awareness by The Boss (usually implicit) creates a more satisfactory game session experience for the player. 

The 'different parts' are the Creative Agenda (CA) of the player, or mode, which have been traditionally explained as 'Gamist', 'Narrativist', and 'Simulationist', which itself is inspired by the "three-fold" model whose origins date back to the Usenet group rec.games.frp.advocacy in the late 1990s. The CAs represent a a prioritised desire that the player wishes to get out of the game in terms of particular style of play, and each of them are equally valid. The Gamist Creative Agenda is about seeking an in-game objective by utilising knowledge about the game system and evaluating the options and risks involved. The Narrativist Creative Agenda is about seeking an active intervention in story development by the character's actions. The Simulationist Creative Agenda is about seeking an in-game sense of "realism" in the story. There have been numerous (and sometimes suprisingly passionate) debates about whether there is just these three Agenda, but after many years of debate there seems to be a settled acceptance on the quantity and meaning.

For a player with a Gamist CA, they are seeking opportunities to win the game, both in terms of the victory conditions of the setting, and in terms of the game system. It involves a competitive approach, even when the activities are cooperative, because the player is evaluating risk and reward, benefits and losses, and short and long-term payoffs. It is the use of tactical and strategic play where the player sees their character facing a challenge and makes a calculation of their chance of success. A dysfunctional experience can arise when The Boss, by fiat, defines a house rule which is contrary to the player's expectations and calculations. This can be avoided by The Boss having providing transparency in whatever House Rules they are using (i.e., publish beforehand and circulate), and by allowing the player to alter stated actions where they were unaware of impromptu changes. 

For a player with a Narrativist CA, a game experience that provides an opportunity to addresses the premise of the story, whether it is through setting, plot, or the interactions with other characters. 'Railroading' is antithetical to the Narrativist Creative Agenda. This is where the player has their character controlled by The Boss; this can occur when it is in conflict with other CAs, and with The Boss's own sense of the Story. In the latter The Boss can impose their own narrativist play (they control the entire setting and NPCs) in relatively a subtle manner. Whilst this is justifiable if a more rewarding storyline for the players can be generated by the redirection, it is important (to quote Rolemaster's *Character Law*) to "avoid a sense of contrivance". 

For a player with a Simulationist CA, a game experience that provides an opportunity to experience the setting in a manner that is internally consistent and "realistic", a position which applies both externally and internally to the characters. Not only should the game world have realistic effects the characters should also behave in a realistic manner in reference to the setting. The player with a Simulationist CA will object where the game system fails to deliver expected results, or characters behave a manner that doesn't make sense to the setting. It is emphasised that the game doesn't have to deliver results that are necessary consistent to expectations of the real-world, but where their is variance it requires consistency and an internal logic. 

The word "agenda" is important. It does not mean that there has to be specific game-system rules for each CA, although this can certainly be helpful, and it is certainly present in *Papers & Paychecks*. It is a player orientation, not a set of game system mechanics. The player may not even be aware, let alone explicitly state, what their CA is at a particular point in play. As a further elaboration, players may be be taking a different CA at different points in time. Players might lean towards a particular CA, and can only use one at a time, but they are not bound to their preferred CA all the time. It is possible, albeit difficult, for The Boss to orient themselves towards multiple CAs in the same scene according to the what the different players are doing. But it is not possible to apply multiple CAs to the same player at the same time. As an agenda it refers to an orientation, thus it is possible for a player to carry out a Narrativist CA and, with the exception of the components of the agenda itself, the game retains a in-world consistency which would otherwise be association with a Simulationist CA.

**System and Application**

There is a body of opinion that game systems don't matter. This is simply not true. It is true the social contract between participants of the game is of primary importance (if people don't behave around the gaming table, even the best game is sunk). It is also true that the exploration of the shared imaginary space with the literary model is the second most important component of a successful game. A imaginative group of players who skilfully play the roles that they've taken up and assisted by a creative narrator, can make for a truly excellent experience. 

But the second half of a roleplaying game is the notion of a game, and a game has rules. Now if the participants are not using the rules at all and engaging in a freeform experience of the setting, that's fair enough - they are roleplaying but not engaging in a roleplaying game as such. It may be that they've deliberately chosen not to follow the game system rules because they do not add to the enjoyment of the game experience - in which game the system does matter.

The sort of design features that lead to a poor game experience are numerous. A common experience is that application of the system gives results that break the sense of verisimilitude and the immersive sense that it generates.  Another example is when the game system provides numerous alternative systems within the game for resolution, where every case becomes a special case. Another problem is where the game system provides overly complex methods for resolution when simpler versions would suffice. Finally, a game system could attempt to be a 'model of reality', rather than a selective model, forgetting that a model must be a simplified version of the reality it is trying to simulate. Or it doesn't cover the important aspects that are likely to be encountered in the game experience.

The practical problems of these game system problems are well known. A lack of verisimilitude is commonly experienced with the refrain "But that's not realistic!". The multitude of game system resolution methods leads to confusion, erercting a barrier of entry and understanding to players. Overly complex resolution methods act a drag on the game experience, as do overly detailed rules, as players attempt to find the game rule relevant to their situation; and a lack of detail leads to players having to make ad-hoc rules which lead to potential of inconsistency.
																																																																																																																																																											
## 4.2 Episode and Season Design

**Probability**

The importance of 'game balance' is often unfairly maligned. There is justification when a game *system* is shoe-horned into arbitrary design in order to provide a sense of balance, however balance in itself is a fair goal in terms of a narrative. What is meant by this is that the challenges that the player characters experience in the game is appropriate to their capabilities. If the challenges are too weak for the characters, the players can be easily bored, if they are too difficult for the characters, the players can become frustrated (and this is *aside* from the fact that the game itself is a deliberately frustrating setting).

Session, Espisode, and Season design should follow the plot trajectory of introduction, rising tension, climax, and denouement. Challenges should fit this model with session arcs existing within episode arcs, existing within season arcs. Initial challenges should be relatively simple as the characters explore their situation. As tension rise there should be genuinely challenging moments as the characters encounter their human and environmental antagonists. Finally, at the point of climax, the characters face a genuinely challenging situation which should be beyond their abilities in normal circumstances, but with a combination of co-operation, cleverness, and exploiting weaknesses discovered in the antogonist, gives them a chance of victory.

A thoroughly realistic game would not such features of course; reality does not care about human notions of narrative or game balance. A serious challenge can confront a character at any point. Of course in a workplace environment there is a degree of structure; a boss has expectations and sometimes even real knowledge of the skills of the employees that they manage and, if they have any degree of competence in their own job, will not assign tasks that are too difficult, nor will they assign tasks that are likely to bore the worker.

The Boss should make use of target numbers to facilite the sense of difficulty and narrative development with a thorough review character characteristics, skills, knowledges and other abilities when designing sessions and episodes. An important factor is the probabilities from the 2d6 die rolls provide an important guide in establishing the target numbers that the characters should face. As this is not a liner progression, the following table provides a guide to the distribution and chances of a required result. In the table below, the "chance of success" is equal or above the dice value.

| Dice Value	| Chance of success	|
|---------------|-----------------------|
| 2		| 100%			|

Note that, as a matter of design and the aesthetic of the original cartoon, the 2d6 resolution mechanic used by *Papers & Paychecks* has a limited range of randomness compared to other systems (e.g., a d20 resolution mechanic, or even a 3d6 resolution mechanic). It is sharply orientated towards the middle-range (6-8) and the combination of characteristic and skill is typically very close to the random contribution as well. This differs from other games where the luck of the die roll can be much greater than the natural and trained abilities of the character. As a result in *Papers & Paychecks* challenge scenes need to be quite focussed on the character's abilities. There is only a minimum range in which the character can simply 'get lucky' with a die roll (and indeed, there is already a mechanism to ensure that), and luck itself will sometimes even not be enough. 

This design gives The Boss some additional control compared to some other game systems in gently leading the episode's plot trajectory. The Boss in *Papers & Paychecks*, if they have designed the episode properly, should be less concerned of the plot going off the rails from a particularly poor or spectacular die-roll. By the same token, it is imperative then that The Boss never design a necessary challenge in a episode that the characters *cannot* overcome. By all means, make it astoudingly difficult. Design the episode's main challenge in such a manner that the PCs need to pool their resources, acquire a special item of equipment, call in favours, *and* get lucky with the die roll, but *never* make the main challenge impossible, unless of course, they are *meant* to fail in order to take the narrative in a different direction.

**Plot Devices and Mechanisms**

Plot devices are often literal device which can be used to push the narrative forward. The device itself can be critical to the story itself (such as The One Ring in 'The Lord of the Rings') or it can be quite independent (the notion of "The MacGuffin", a term popularised by Alfred Hitchcock, of which the falcon in 'The Maltese Falcon' is a classic example). Judicious use of plot devices can drive the characters into making critical decisions about the direction of the narrative, and as such the devices themselves have to be important to characters, that the character would feel attachments towards; perhaps a treasured item from their own possessions, or an object of great desire. As always, the Boss should listen for these signals that often come from the player's description of their characters. In a world where objects themselves have particular personalities the opportunity exists to present plot devices with additional layer of humour. The character who desires a "hot rod" of a car will end with something like Stephen King's 'Christine', whereas the one who seeks the best computer system will find themselves with William Gibson's 'Wintermute' and so forth. 

Literal objects are, of course, not the only form of plot device. Sometimes they more abstract elements which are sometimes referred to as "plot mechanism" to differentiate. Consider events such as mistaken identity and intrigue (consider Shakespeare's use of these comic plot devices), hallucinations (e.g., Phillip K. Dick), red herrings in mysteries, and so forth. Overall however, plot devices - whether literal or abstract - must apply the dramatic rule of "Chekov's Gun"; if an element is introduced to a story, it must become relevant to the story. If a gun is introduced, it must be fired, and in a dramatic manner - otherwise what's the point of introducing it?

Because *Papers & Paychecks* is set in a workplace environment there is numerous opportunties to introduce all sorts of the usual elements of plot devices and plot mechanisms. However the specific environment also means the opportunity to make use of something that we modern workers will be all too familiar with - ridiculous workplace rules. The following is a small selection of some real world examples. What this are often bizarre in the own right, again it is emphasised that if a Boss does see the need to introduce them, that they are for a narrative and character development purpose.

* Performance criteria being based on work that has nothing to do with your job. "[M]y performance evaluation is based on student improvement on the STAR literacy test. I teach wood shop."
* Special rules for special divisions of the organisation. "HR held a meeting to tell us that there was too much swearing on the sales floor. Someone raised their hand and pointed out that swearing is very common in our industry and that is the way that our customers speak. HR later sent out a memo explaining that swearing should be limited to conversations with clients."
* Special perks for compliant workers or position. "The company hired a 'Corporate Efficiency Specialist' [who] implemented all kinds of rules... the higher your office rank, the more 'perks' you get... Number of pictures you are allowed in your cubicle... Whether you are allowed to have a potted plant or not. Coffee mugs were only allowed to senior employees. Others had to use paper cups. Being allowed to leave the office for lunch."
* Prohibitive stationery rules. :I once needed a pen. Figured this was a reasonable ask. Went to the supply closet on my floor, which was locked. Asked the floor's admin, she told me to go to the main supply room in the basement. Went to the basement and explained my situation of needing a pen. They told me all requests for supplies must be approved by my department head. Problem is, being new, I'd never met my department head. She also worked in San Francisco (I worked in Milwaukee), so I needed to send an email both introducing myself, and asking her if I had permission to get a pen from the supply closet."
* Corporate language. "My workplace doesn't let you use the word 'problems'. Instead, we have to say 'challenges' if something is wrong. As a problem is a negative word, and challenges promotes the fact that there is room to fix said problem"
* Restrictive attendance rules. "If you were literally :01 seconds late clocking in, even hours before the store opened, it was a really, really big deal. You'd not only be formally written up, but lectured like a child often times berated even. If you were tardy three times, bye-bye. HOWEVER, if you no-showed and then called 2 hours later saying you were sick?—okay, thank you, feel better. This trained everyone to just take a sick day instead of being half a second late to work."

**Events and Personality Types**

When driving the characters to make decisions, triggers to the personality of the character is primary. These can be introduced at any point during an episode or even as an ongoing obstacle. Whilst there are a number which can be orientated towards the those elements which the character has independently of their personality, there is much comic joy in introducing elements which challenge the character's personality type. The following are some examples, all of which can constitute "adventure seeds" of their very own.

ESFJ (Kiersey Providers): The Provider character finds that others are refusing their offers of assistance for real or imagined slights. Their own manager questions their "interfering" behaviour. "If we want your help we'll ask for it". Another character really needs the Provider's assistance, but the Provider, for whatever reason, cannot give it to them.

ISFJ (Kiersey Protectors): A mistake or other action by the Protector leads to a breach of security or safety. After being appropriately castigated, the Protector is removed from a project. However they then discover a way to fix their previous error, but only they can do it - and now they are prohibited from doing so.

ESTJ (Kiersey Supervisors): The Supervisor character experiences numerous frustrations in their desire to manage situations both external and internal because their manager is incompetent, impractical, oblivious to reason, and in absolute command. Worse still, the are a micromanager and expect the Supervisor to follow their destructive orders.

ISTJ (Kiersey Inspectors): The Inspector is given the task to review a supposedly critical project. The project lacks guidelines, objectives, and a chain of command. When this is reported, they are castigated for bringing the project into poor repute and are ordered to rewrite their report to put the project in a positive light.
 
ESFP (Kiersey Performer): The Performer is given a task in historical archiving. The work is solitary, the environment dull, and there's no right or opportunity to change it. Their immediate manager is an utterly dour and humourless individual. 

ISFP (Kiersey Composer): The Composer character is given a detailed operational task, where every procedure and sub-procedure is carefully managed and adventerous aleration on even the most minor matter will lead to cascading failures. Proposals by the character for alteration to the procedures are rejected as 'unoriginal'.

ESTP (Kiersey Promoter): The Promoter character is working on an exciting, transformative project that has enormous ramifications. However it is also under a strict non-disclosure agreement, the work environment is smothered by deteailed regulations and mundane tasks, and the co-workers are thoroughly indifferent to the potential of the final product. 

ISTP (Kiersey Crafter): The Crafter notices cow-orkers struggling over a series of manual and technical tasks for which they are particularly well-suited but cannot intervene due to Occupational Health and Safety regulations. If they raise the issue with their superiors they will be assigned the task to write a strategic review to implement changes to the regulations - but not the specific changes themselves.

ENFP (Kiersey Champion): The Champion is given a set of technical tasks which they are poorly suited for with a strict schedule and require a great deal of indvidual focus and concentration. When seeking assistance their necessary cow-orkers are quiet and studious but otherwise uninspired.

INFP (Kiersey Healer): Assigned empirical tasks for a morally questionable outcome, the Healer character finds themselves the target for widespread and even public inter-office gossip for their sense of taste. 

ENFJ (Kiersey Teacher): An authority which the Teacher character respects is making some terrible decisions. Attempts to communicate these issues are turned on to the character who is accused of gratuitous self-promotion, and is given a mountain of analytical work to complete. 

INFJ (Kiersey Counsellor): The Counselor character find themselves working in a vertical marketing scheme which is based on a morally abhorrent foundation (e.g. a company that produces medical-grade pain killers is purchased by an arms manufacturer which actively lobbies for military conflicts). Their immediate manager has no ethical qualms about the situation seeing the possibility of profit as an opportunity for expansion and promotion.

ENTP (Kiersey Inventor): The Inventor character finds themselves in a work project which criticism of plans or cow-orkers is seriously discouraged in the interest of ensuring a cohesive team. When the character raises matters for debate, they are assigned a nightmare set of time-consuming tasks which are simple and routine. 

INTP (Kiersey Architect): The Architect character is assigned the task of a social and qualitative survey on a very well-known topic. The subjects who they interview however are completely ignorant of the subject-matter at hand and will respond to survey questions will unsubstantiated leaps of logic based on emotional responses. 

ENTJ (Kiersey Fieldmarshal): After several successes the Fieldmarshall character is again overlooked for a more senior strategic position who is demonstrably inferior in every way to the tasks required. When the inevitable disasters occur, the new strategist assigns the Field Marshall a series of time-consuming "feel good" exercises.

INTJ (Kiersey Mastermind): The Mastermind is put on the spot to provide a public speech on a subject which they know little about to an audience of experts. Whilst preparing for their presentation their time is challenged by a succession of management meetings for progress updates.

# 5.0 Scenarios : Fear and Loathing in Wellington

## 5.1 Setting :

## 5.2 Season 1, Episode 1

MY LIFE WITH BOSS 
by Dan LEstrange
“The life of a executive is a hard one. The horrific things you do make it difficult to feel good about yourself. If only  someone loved you. 

A dysfunctional relationship with your Boss in the high powered life of Corporate Executives for Newsprint Limited. A  game of modern horror and self loathing set with a backdrop of life at the top of the Journalism field.  

My Life with the Boss is a corporate adaptation of Paul Czege's award winning game My Life with Master. 

Prepare to  serve a most ambitious sociopath and eventually be his undoing.

My Life with the Boss was run at KapCon  XIX in Wellington, New Zealand, in January 2010.

There are six playable characters in My Life with the Boss. Forest Deacon, Chief Financial Officer, John Goines, Marketing Manager, Julia Wright, Chief of Visual Media, Verity Williams, Chief Editor, Jason Schuster, Chief Journalist, Rebekah Caulfield, Director of Human Resources Each character has been pre­created to fit convention play. Characters are detailed at the end of this document.

Each character has a more than human trait  and a less than human trait listed on their character sheets. These traits are, in practice, used as colour for the characters, yet they can do things to the flow of the game. Take notes of each more than human / less than human, anything that falls under these traits should be considered an automatic success (or failure).

Each character has two connections from the following: Petra Daniels (local Shortland Street actress) , Henry Dunant (local leader of Red Cross Orphans Charity) , Paul Reynolds (Jr Accountant of Newsprint Limited) , Yousef Ramoud (Routers Co – competitor Journalist) , “Open Wound” (Government Insider) . These connections provide both victims and moral support to the characters and each is used to inspire emotive responses from the characters. As they are tied to successfully resisting the Boss, the characters should want to assist and not harm their own connections and be reluctant to harm connections of other characters. 

**In detail – Petra Daniels (Local Celebrity)**

Petra is a local actress from a daily New Zealand soap – Shortland Street. She is has a ethereal beauty and her character suffers tragedy after tragedy during the soap which means that she inspires pity. Petra is however, rather new to the media scene, she could also be called naïve in respect to handling the media.

Petra is the target of the first commands for Julia Wright, Chief of Visual Media. As Julia is instructed to get raunchy pictures of Petra for page three of the Newspaper. This is a big step for the actress (if she is willing) as this will dash her current media image of homely goodness.

Petra has connections with John Goines (Marketing), whom she used to date before getting a media profile, Verity Williams (HR) whom she has had business dealings with and Jason Schuster (Chief Journalist) who has been stalking her for many years (although Petra is unaware of the infatuation).

Petra should inspire pity from the characters, as a personality who being abused by the media (and by extension the Boss) which will eventually result in her meltdown.  For inspiration to play her, look to Susan Boyle (UK Idol runner up), Lindsay Lohan (from before she became a media sensation to her current state) and Brittney Spears (with her public meltdown).

**In detail – Henry Dunant (Red Cross worker)**
Henry Dunant runs the local (struggling) Red Cross orphanage, just out of town. The orphanage is currently on a “campout” – as much from necessity as from choice – and Henry and his volunteers are doing the best that they can to ensure the orphans are well taken care of. Henry is aware of the media scene, although places little value on its worth. 

He is a campaigner for a better world through hard work, honest donations and good intentions.
Henry is the target of John Goines first command, and John Goines has been instructed to “woo” Henry to support a marketing campaign and generate a good public perception of Newsprint Limited. Henry has connections with Rebekah Caulfield (who has been siphoning funds to the Red Cross for years), Verity Williams (who he dates and has a relationship with), and Forest Deacon (old mate and drinking buddy).
Henry should inspire admiration, or a difficult struggle. Henry is doing the good work under a good cause, a complete opposite of the characters own plight. Henry is inspired by real world characters like Fred Hollows (Australian Eye specialist who used to work in the Philippines), Mother Teresa and Princess Diana.

**In detail – Paul Reynolds (Jr Accountant)**
Paul works for Newsprint Limited as a Junior Accountant, a job he got through his uncle (and connection) Forest Deacon. Paul is one of the linesmen of Newsprint Limited and is excited about his opportunity to work with Newsprint as all young employees are. Paul is unaware of the media scene, although is excited to learn. He is eager to do what his superiors ask of him and is generally unaware of the consequences of his actions.

Paul has connections with Forest Deacon (his Uncle) and Jason Schuster (a good mate).

Paul is the target of the first command of Verity Williams (Chief Editor), and Verity is instructed to send Paul into a potentially deadly situation because the Boss is disparaging of Paul’s letter to management. Paul is indirectly affected by Rebekah Caulfield’s first command as well, as Paul falls under the group that the Boss instructs Rebekah to cull from the company ranks.

Paul should inspire hope from the Characters, he represents what the characters may have felt when they began at Newsprint and what they may be feeling at the start of the game (a wish to do well for the Boss). Only the character increasing self loathing and realisation that the Boss is a tyrant differentiates Paul from the characters. Paul is inspired by any who has recently joined the job market, a person willing to go the extra step in order to cement their career in a 
new industry.

**In detail – Yousef Ramoud (Competitor Journalist)**
Yousef works for a rival company to Newsprint Limited; however he should represent the idea of a friendly rivalry rather than a hostile one. Yousef should give no reason for the characters to dislike him, other than the instructions of the Boss – he is meant to represent a healthy competition in the workplace. Yousef is also an Arab, and thus highlights the unfair racial bigotry that can arise in the media’s interpretation of public perception of Arabs and those from the middle east.

Yousef is well aware of the media’s capabilities and will fight back – targeting the organisation of Newsprint rather than the individual – if attacked by the characters. Yousef has connections with John Goines (old school mate) and Julia Wright (professional colleagues). Yousef is the target of the first command of Forest Deacon, Forest is instructed to “find dirt” on Yousef and discredit him as a journalist.

Yousef should inspire respect from the players, while the media industry can be considered to be a cutthroat business (especially in the Boss’s eyes), Yousef should seem to rise above it and still fight fairly. Yousef is inspired by the overwhelming majority of investigative journalists in the media industry to date. A real passion for getting the truth of the story and no love of the sensationalist practices of some papers in order to sell more.

**In detail – “Open Wound” (Government Insider)**
“Open Wound” is the codename for a Government insider. He represents the myriad of contacts that the journalistic community has to allow them to get the inside scoop on operations by the government. “Open Wound” also represents the shadier side of investigative journalism, where a no­questions­asked policy is still in place. “Open Wound” is the least at risk by the activities of the characters, his identity is a secret, his background shrouded in mystery. He will willingly go along with the characters if they chose to misdirect the activities of “Open Wound” to another connection.

“Open Wound” has connections with Julia Wright (Chief of Visual media) and Verity Williams (Chief Editor) as an informant and verifier of information. “Open Wound” is the target of the first command of Jason Schuster (Chief Journalist), and Jason is instructed to expose him to the Boss and find out everything that Jason is able to.“Open Wound” is inspired by Deep Throat (the insider from X­files and the Watergate scandal).

**The Boss**
Central to the success of My Life with the Boss, is the Boss. The aspects of the Boss are below (as per My Life with Master rules)

Aspect: Boss/CEO
Type:  Teacher
Needs:
Wants: Domination
More Money, More Readers, to be proven right in all things
Some aspects of the Boss
The following are some of the characteristics that the Boss will (or may) display during the game.
Ruthlessness., Uncaring., Profiteer., Driven., Racist., Rich., Uncharitable., Environmental Terrorist.,  Sensationalist., 
Bureaucratic., Overbearing., Pedantic., Favouritism., Ambiguous expectations/Goals., Loud/Rude/Talks over staff., 
Takes credit from staff.,  Discuss negative events continually and searches for faults in staff.,  Lacks integrity, breaks 
promises, and is dishonest., Unethical., Belittling., Micromanaging

**Playing the Boss**

Firstly, it must be said that the Boss is should not be treated like a normal character. The Boss should played more like considered a nature or a driving motivator to get the characters into a position where they feel that there is nothing more that they can do but resist the 

Boss’s commands.
When playing the Boss, it is useful to have a trigger – in my case it was a cigar – that highlights that the GM is playing the Boss to the players and allows the GM to get into character to say and do the things that the Boss wants to do.

The Boss is bigoted, racist, nasty and ruthless – however the Boss can not complete his objectives without the characters involvement (the Boss is also lazy). He has a confidence that his minions will attempt to complete the tasks as instructed, however lacks confidence in their ability to actually complete those tasks.

The Boss is misunderstood, the Boss wants to be liked, the Boss wants to be appreciated, and the Boss wants to be respected. However when the characters show that they “like” the Boss, or appreciate the Boss or even respect the Boss, the Boss can see through their guile and realises that it is just a grab for power of the Boss’s assets. 

The Boss has an extremely powerful position in the game, at least initially the characters will be unable to resist the Boss’s commands, the Boss should however begin with commands that allow the players to get into character, and continually escalate those commands until the characters realise that the Boss’s power is hollow and the characters have no choice but to resist. The Boss must be memorable if this game is to succeed. Be prepared to be flamboyant, loud, outspoken and to make a performance of the times that the Boss is centre stage.

The Boss is not the GM, nor is the GM the Boss. 

The Boss is just a motivator for the players, a source of information on what impossible task they should attempt to complete. The Boss should be an obstacle for the characters to overcome, not a cherished NPC who can escape any conflict.

**Introduction of the Game**
 
Always introduce yourself and the game, explain the rules and take your time about this. Be familiar with the rules as written of My Life with Master.

My conventions that are not listed in the rules as written for My Life with Master.
• Desperation, Intimacy and Sincerity dice are the domain of both the players and the GM. This will need to be  introduced at the start of play with the importance of the dice to success strenuously stressed.
• No more than 1 overture action in a row for any character.
• End Game and Horror Revealed scenes happen at set times. These will be extra scenes. Horror Revealed 
scenes are slightly re jigged to fit the game within the convention time frames.
• Bring each scene to its conflict as quickly as possible, the answer “yes, and...” should be the only one the GM requires until a conflict is declared (by either the player or GM). On average you will only have about 5 minutes to complete a scene.

**Horror Revealed**

In a slight change about the Horror Revealed, unfortunately in a convention setting you do not have the time to “waste” a scene with a character describing the horror revealed as opposed to generating Love or Self Loathing.
 
Horror Revealed only appearing at one of three times (at the 1 st  hour mark, the 2 nd  hour mark and in practice just before the end game mark), the player with the “Horror Revealed” is then instructed to describe the response of the public to the activities of the characters thus far.

I would begin by answering an open question relevant to the current events in the game – for example – “given that Henry Dunant has been vilified in the media, how does the public react to further fundraising by the Red Cross?”, and allowing the player to describe the response.

Opening Statement / Setting the scene

The scene: Characters are all sitting at the board room table, the Boss is hidden behind a large chair. He’s on the phone.

"Look here, you snivelling little twit, when I say I want those pictures ­ I want those pictures, I don't care if your halfwit mother wants to have a white xmas, you ain't getting any leave until those pictures hit MY desk. In fact, stuff it,  you ain't getting any leave period ­ sit your arse down in the park outside that dumb bitch Petra Daniels house and wait for the picture you god damned lazy shit."

He turns to the characters

"Right, for Christ sake ­ hire a bloody Jew to do a job and you need to give them god damned road map just so they can find their own chopped up dick. This stupid company would go down the tubes if it wasn't for strong leadership and direction ­ MINE ­ I don't know why I hired you lot either ­ right lot of useless fools you are."

"Who’s up first?"

Whomever chooses to take the first command will be your starting character, travel left from that player until you return to that player a second time (i.e. all characters have had two scenes, usually a command and an overture or attempting to complete a command). 

At that second return, you should be able to do an End Game or Horror Revealed check.

**First Run of Commands and player actions**

The following is the initial commands given to each character, note that with the exception of the first command (the 
player who responded to the opening statement) each character can choose to take a command, do an overture or act out 
a command.

Players should be able to set the scene for what ever action they choose to take, the GM should provide suggestions based on the background material, but the players should have most of the narrative control.
The players are likely to take the narrative outside the boardroom, or to other unusual places, the GM’s best answer to any suggestion or request by the players is “yes, and...” The game is currently set in Wellington, New Zealand (feel free to change as relevant). 

Each player should have the opportunity twice to perform an action (within the first round it is extremely likely that everyone gets at least one command). To keep to the time line, this should only take about 50 minutes to complete.


*Forest Deacon*

"The sodding bean counter huh? Keeping your retirement fund clean are you? ­ Yes I know about your tucked away savings ­ be thankful that I haven't turned you in to the IRD. Right, I have a job for you, simple enough for even you to do. Our reader numbers are down, and the competition is getting nasty. Time to buy them out. Routers Co is within the price range, but I want to buy it for a steal ­ their head journalist ­ Ramoud ­ he supplies all the integrity for the company ­ defame him. Destroy him. Make him nothing in the readers’ eyes. I want scandal; I want to know that he’s a gay loving, neo­fascist, terrorism supporting Arab. Make it happen!"

*John Goines*

"Oh Christ its you. You sold your own mother yet? My lord man I ain't seen such a dirty leech since my time in Malaysia ­ god damned Malaysians ­ suck your blood they do. Steal the shirt from your back they will. So... what can I have you do for me huh? Something you won't stuff up hopefully, but I'm not holding my breath. I need a new corporate face of Newsprint limited, something bulldust and squishy, light­hearted yet.... heart­warming to the stupid masses. Something.... charities... charities are good. There is a Red Cross orphans camp up near Trentham way, sign a deal ­ get them to advocate buying Newsprint publications. Get their boss up here for a photo shot ­ shaking hands and that sort of bulldust rubbish ­ but make sure they are presentable... I want sympathetic, not pathetic."

*Julia Wright*

"How are you doing honey? Liking the good life down in that library of yours? You know you could make VP one day; you'd just need to pop those tits out once and a while and do a dance for the rest of the team. The boys here would be salivating over you in no time. Your job is a simple one baby, time for Newsprint to get glossy ­ and I mean sexy. I need hot pics... and I mean HOT. Get me my nude shot of Petra Daniels ­ you know the one ­ the slut from Shorty Street. That'll bring the readers in, everyone likes a bit of arse on page 2! and would it hurt to wear a low cut top from time to time! Its like looking at a slate wall every time you walk in here..."

*Verity Williams*

"Verity ­ my overpaid, under qualified, waste of time editor. What do you do when not trying to screw up my paper? Pull the wings off flies? Steal candy from children? Christ if I was a father I would get the child to run 10 miles to get  away from your ugly mug ­ the wicked witch of the west you are! Well its time to earn your keep, accounting have a new boy ­ Paul something... Reynolds I think. He sent me a bloody letter "Dear Sir, I very much enjoy being part of your fine company and would like to express my gratitude about granting me this opportunity to help build Newsprint to the best that it can be" ­- brown noser if any I thought so. Time to teach him a lesson ­ there is a Gang HQ out in Newtown, tell him that the boss needs something special from the Gang leader ­ something that would make the Boss even more grateful that we hired this snivelling turd... convince Paul to go get me a Daddie fresh from the pen!... 
ha ha!... should come back bow legged he will!"

(FYI – “Daddie fresh from the Pen” is a recently release Sexual Offender)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Cobras_%28gang%29

*Jason Schuster*

"I thought we fired you? God Damn I need to talk to HR. Right, as we have you we should bloody well use you. There is a secret government agent ­ "Open Wound" is what they call him. He needs to be exposed ­ my friends in the Beehive are getting might pissed off at the info he is spreading around ­ and I need my friends to be happy. I need to know his name, his department, his fucking favourite position and I need it recorded. Bring me that recording!"

Rebekah Caulfield

"Still stalking all the office hotties are we Beks? I know your secret. Looking up files is just another form of a peep show to you isn't it? Okay, I have jobs for you. I am getting sick and tired of all the bloody slackers that we have hired... fucking ugly women with kids, Jews and Malay. Slackers all of them. Fire them. All. I want all their contracts terminated by the end of the week ­ and hire me some new people ­ attractive women, Aryan men ­ business men, real workers ­ none with kids. Call it a restructure or something, and make it look nice in the press."


Check for End Game / Horror Revealed

After each player has had a turn twice, go around the table and do a check for End Game or Horror Revealed. This is also a good time to summarise what is happening in the game world (the Horror Revealed is a good way to allow the players to do the summarising).

N.B. Horror Revealed:

In a slight change about the Horror Revealed, unfortunately in a convention setting you do not have the time to “waste” a scene with a character describing the horror revealed as opposed to generating Love or Self Loathing.
 
Horror Revealed only appearing at one of three times (at the 1 st  hour mark, the 2 nd  hour mark and in practice just before  the end game mark), the player with the “Horror Revealed” is then instructed to describe the response of the public to the activities of the characters thus far.

I would begin by answering an open question relevant to the current events in the game – for example – “given that Henry Dunant has been vilified in the media, how does the public react to further fundraising by the Red Cross?”, and allowing the player to describe the response.

Second Round commands and player actions

The second commands the characters received are partially dependent on the results of their first command (if they have or haven’t completed it), and partially dependent on the actions of the other characters. Guides to the characters  for orders follow.

As a loose guide follow the below instructions, however always escalate.

Forest Deacon

If successful ­ Ramoud should be disgraced. Townsfolk should become more cynical about life, morose and depressed. Anti­monopoly or anti­globalisation protests are starting to rise and often they stop at the Newsprint Limited head office. While Newsprint haven't yet brought Routers (although CFO could do it), it is obvious to the population that this  is what it intends. Newsprint limited reader numbers remain unchanged. CFO next task could be to FIRE all the workers from Routers and set it up as a shell company for Newsprint to launder money ­ Paul would be “volunteered” to oversee this operation.

If unsuccessful ­ Routers (and Ramoud) runs a campaign against monopolies and greedy corporations with their wealthy benefactors. The boss is not impressed. Orders CFO to start laundering money (with a fall guy ­ Paul) hiding it as donations to the Red Cross. 

The key to Forest’s escalation is either through his connections (putting Paul or Henry Dunant into trouble or dire straights), or using his money (his “more than human”) for increasingly nefarious deeds. Order Forest to buy things – like the Red Cross and then destroy them, order Forest to cut funding to things – like staff members superannuation or leave payouts – order him to use that money for the Boss’s benefit.

Eventually Forest will crack, and that really is the idea.

John Goines

If successful ­ Henry Dunant should be ready for photo shoot/publicity stunt with the Boss ­ Townsfolk should laud Henry Dunant as reaching one of the big corporations ­ Henry is nominated for Wellingtonian of the Year (for his charity work and stuff). Newsprint reader numbers remain the same. The boss is not impressed, in fact, he’s angry. 

DCC next task should be to put Petra Daniels (naked) and Henry Dunant in the same room. Time to disgrace him. If unsuccessful, the boss is not impressed and above remains.

John Goines is often played as a suave media marketeer, so attack him were it hurts. He generally needs orders that are leading others into trouble, not trouble for himself directly – for example, bringing Petra Daniels to the Boss’s room and ordered to remain outside, or creating situations where Yousef could be confused as a terrorist (i.e. “mistakenly” putting a story out with a picture of Yousef about potential terrorism in Wellington).

Julia Wright

If successful ­ Petra Daniels should be "exposed" in the media ­ Townsfolk start to hunger for more sensationalist press ­reality TV shows start to rise, the porn industry in Wellington reports record growth. Newsprint reader numbers increase, the boss wants more. CVM next task would be to photograph government officials in compromising positions. 

Get the scandal.

If unsuccessful, the Boss is not impressed, his page 2 doesn't have a story ­ orders CVM to get insider story pronto.  Either that or lose her job!!

Julia can be attacked through her connections, “Open Wound” or Yousef, although generally they do not hold a lot of weight with the players. Julia is often portrayed as a confident worker, successful in her own right, and further attacks on her legitimacy as a photojournalist has worked in escalation with Julia. Order Julia to take photos of prominent connections in the game and then have the Newspaper print outright lies about what the photo is attempting to portray (or lies about what the situation was in the first place). Order Julia to then begin doctoring photos to match scandalous  stories.

Verity Williams

If successful Paul should be harmed ­ Violence and riots are more common by the townsfolk, violence seems "verified" as a valid course of action. Sexual assaults and rape on the rise. The boss doesn't care Newsprint readership declines (which doesn't make the boss happy). Orders CE to blame the Red Cross for the rise in violence (it harbours criminals), to get proof that this is happening, and to bring the Red Cross to justice. Also Paul is brought to the office and CE blamed for his plight.

If unsuccessful, Paul unharmed, bosses "fun" was inhibited, he’s not happy. Orders CE to verify a government conspiracy (that the Govt is bankrupt, John Key is a puppet to the US, and the RBA is about to go under) with her "contact" and rival company Routers Co.

Verity’s first instruction is the one that brings violence into the game, and thus escalation of Verity’s orders in practice  tends to be quite natural. Order her to allow stories of Paul Reynolds (lies all) to go to print, have the Boss order her to  obey the “Boys Club” and step aside for another editor (who doesn’t do any editing) and then order her to take the fall  when he fails. Verity in practice also tends to get out there and attempt to stop others from completing their orders (in particular re Henry Dunant).

Jason Schuster

If successful ­ "Open Wound" should be compromised but either way ­ Townsfolk want to know more about the 
Governments dealings, racial attacks on the rise as the Boss slants the story to the fact that he is a Jew (or Malay, or an  ugly woman). Newsprint Readership rises, the Boss wants more. Needs more proof that the Jews are responsible for all things wrong in this world. Orders DOO out to get proof that Henry Dunant (another Jew) is a corrupt cheat, and if they can't find the info ­ to make it up! 

Jason is a true journalist, so continue to order him to “get the story”. And if he can’t get the story to “make the story”. 

This can be useful for the players to keep track of the activities of the game if Jason is ordered to track and report. 

Eventually the Boss will order Jason to get the story on the assassination of one of the connections, or rather hands Jason a Gun.
 
Rebekah Caulfield

If successful, all Jews/ugly women/Malays should be fired ­ including Paul Reynolds, and new employees hired. Townsfolk accept the "restructure" or whatever it was called without comment, racial attacks on the rise. No change in Newsprint readership. Paul Reynolds starts a lawsuit for illegal dismissal and Boss orders DHR to justify the dismissals or bribe the courts to throw the case out ­ Open Wound could be useful there. (either mentioned by boss or others)

If unsuccessful, Boss not happy. Orders DHR to cut costs in other ways, cut everyone’s pay by 50% (except the boss) and her own by 75%. Initiate a performance reviews on all senior staff and report back.
Rebekah’s escalation tends to go towards ordering her to strip other characters of their benefits (listed on the character  sheets), or Ordering Rebekah to oversee further cutbacks in Newsprint. Attacking Rebekahs connections Petra Daniels  or Henry Dunant tends also to stir Rebekah into action.

As MacKenzie's layout was seen by more and more people, a collective shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed ­ "looking like rabbits in the headlights" ­ as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.
Quote by Peter Chippendale and Chris Horrie on The Sun's reporting of  the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster

Hints, Tips and Advice
The following are some final hints, tips and advice before we get to the End Game.
1. Keep the game moving, don’t stop
2. Escalate, Escalate, Escalate
3. Watch your time, if necessary award “Self­Loathing” or “Love” to characters outside their turn if the actions 
seem warranted and your time is low
4. “Yes and...” is your greatest tool as a GM.
5. You have 5 minutes to bring each scene to a conflict point, know the My Life With Master system intuitively 
to bring out what the players need to roll as soon as they ask.
6. Continue to encourage the players to award sincerity, intimacy or desperation dice. Lead by example.

It is quite possible that you have a troublesome player or two; usually these are quickly identified as a player who is enjoying the depraved requests of the Boss and is asking for more, thus not resisting the Boss (and thus not being able to complete the game).

There are a couple of strategies for this sort of player, the first is to escalate the commands given by the Boss until the  player is in a situation where they can do nothing but resist. This is fraught with difficulty as it may result in the GM  breaking the rules set down in the disclaimer.

The second strategy is to give the character commands that are impossible to complete. One of my examples was ordering the character to go around to all of the shops in the Wellington region and replace the front page with a new one; this was an action that the character had no chance of completing. Further escalation of these sorts of commands eventually leads the player to the believe that the Boss is really just a nasty person and should be resisted.

**End Game**

The End Game possibilities are as wild as the players you will have, however a couple of points the GM should be aware of at the End Game stage.

The character will always “win” the End Game, and the Boss knows this, he will attempt to go all out to defend or fight or attempt to convince the character that going against the Boss is not the best way. The Boss will beg, he will make lewd remarks, he will insult, he will cry, he will scream. As the GM it is your responsibility to make this happen, stand  up and take it too the players – this is the Boss’s last hurrah.

**Conclusions**

Know the background of the game, know the rules of *Papers & Paychecks*, and portray the Boss as wild as you can. 

These three elements will ensure that you have a unique and fun experience when playing My Life with the Boss.

In the two times I ran My Life with the Boss at KapCon, both ended very differently and took very different tracks. This is to be expected, some characters will fixate on protecting their connections and growing Love, others will attempt to satisfy the Boss (growing their Self Loathing) and others again will attempt to disrupt the actions of the other  characters. 

Ultimately however, and this is what My Life with Master is about, it will return to resisting the Boss and completing the End Game.

As I have suggested, play the Boss to the hilt, this is one of the ways that the players will remember this game and get enjoyment from it, the second point in which the players will have enjoyment is the relative freedom they have from a GM that says “yes, and ...” to all of their requests.
